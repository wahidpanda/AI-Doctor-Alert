{"text": "What's you in? I've had this pain on the outside of my right elbow now. I first started noticing it several months ago, but recently it's just been more painful. Okay.

All right. And now I'm going to get you to um, just palpate um, that lateral, or yeah, the lateral aspect of that elbow. And you let me know if you feel pain when you push, push on that. I feel it's pain at the lateral, lateral elbow. How about the medial aspect? No pain. Okay. And have it when you palpate your forearm and your biceps. Uh, no pain. Okay. All right.

Uh, no, but that doesn't cause any pain. Have about when you extend your shoulder all the way up. No, nothing there. And then. Okay. And then flexing your, uh, sorry, adefting your shoulder. Not feels normal. All right. And then have about when you pronate and supinate your forearms. Uh, pronation. So like twist your arm inward so that your palm is facing the floor. No, that doesn't really cause any pain pronation and supination. Okay. All right. Um, all right. And then are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions? Um, I'm healthy. You're healthy. Okay. And then do you have, have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past? I had a surgery for a C section for my, my son, um, but that's, that's it. Okay. Okay. And, um, how long ago was that? That was about 17 years ago. Okay. And was that an emergency C section? Uh, no, it was not. Okay. Um, and then are you on any medications?

Um, no, I haven't been around anybody who's been sick. Okay. Any recent travel? Uh, nope. I've been at home. Um, I think those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself? Uh, no. Well, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my, in my elbow. Yeah. So right now it seems like you may have a case of something called, um, lateral epicon delitis. So it's also known as, uh, tennis elbow. Um, and there are a lot of things I could kind of predispose you to this. Um, so it could be like the repetitive strain at work. Um, and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor, muscle group there. Um, so for this, we basically recommend, um, a couple of things to manage the pain. Uh, but first, uh, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures. Um, so to help you treat this, um, we recommend some activity modifications. So, um, at work, not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those extensor forum muscles. Um, and then you can use some, uh, use the compression sleeve as well. Continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain. And, uh, really important is physical therapy, um, to increase mobility and strength in that arm. Uh, and as well, you can apply things like ice, um, to it for, like the pain and swelling if you see any. Uh, yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most. Uh, but normally it does, um, go away in a couple months with some physical therapy and the, the compression and splints if you choose to do that. How does that sound? Yeah, that sounds, um, good.

{"text": "Hey Doc, I'm a 45 year old man. I'm just coming in. I'm worried there's a little rash on my leg. I'm getting nervous about. Hi. So I understand you have a rash on your leg. I don't really know what I would call it. That's what I told the nurse when I came in, but it's more hurts than anything. Right. How long have you been going on for? It's been looking weird for about a week, but only yes. It started hurting yesterday. It's sort of looking strange. And I just wanted to come in to get it checked out. OK. When you say it's looking strange, can you tell me what you mean by that? Slow one. It looks bigger than it did before. Meanor, if that makes sense. Slow one. OK. Is it red? Yeah, it's red. It's turning more red, kind of in the area around it. I've got these scabs. I've got diabetes and dogs. I think the best with it. I haven't scratched in at it. And normally it's not that bad, but this is just strange looking. There's no other word for it. OK. Have you ever had anything like this before? I guess you've kind of just said that you didn't, but I was double checked. No, no. Well, I've had occasional ulcers and sometimes I've banged my toe, not exactly the best, taking care of my feet, but this is the first time I've gone something that I've just never seen it before. OK. Do you have any ulcers right now on your feet? I think so. When I last saw this little family dog, I think I've got an ulcer on my left heel, but I think it's doing all right. OK. And what leg are you having this problem with right now? So I'm right. So my ankle. OK. How have your sugar been controlled, breaking me? I just thought measuring them. Yeah, last time I measured it was pretty bad. I think I A1C last time was like nine and something. I'm trying better to be with it. This is hard with work, you know? For sure, I can imagine. So in general, even if you don't know your number for your sugar, have you felt worse than usual lately? Have you felt run down at all? Yeah, actually I have. Being more and feel hungry sometimes is tired, but how? No, it's hard to tell. There's an off-lock going on in my life right now with the kids, but it's hard to tell. I think, yeah, I need to see my family dog. OK. Definitely, you know, a good idea moving forward just to make sure you get on top of these things. But I'm glad you came in today. So we can, you know, have a better look at you and make sure that there's nothing super concerning going on. So in addition to this, have you had any other new symptoms? Symptoms, I feel a little hot actually. When the swelling started, it also started leaking this like white stuff from one of the, what used to be a scab. So now, like kind of open room now. OK. OK. So when did you start feeling hot? Honestly, last 12 hours. OK. Can you take your temperature at all? No. I don't have a thermometer at home. Have you had any difficulty breathing? No. No. Any testing? Nope. Have you noticed that your left, sorry, your right leg feels any hotter than the left? Yeah. Yeah, it does actually. Changing socks the other day. Yeah. Hey, have you like, have you felt ill recently? Have you been sick at all? Hmm. Aside from just feeling a little crummy last couple of weeks, no. Don't really less energy today. But I was up last night thinking about this. Yeah. Wanted to come in and talk. Yeah, I'm, you do the right thing. I'm glad that you're in today. Is the pain on your leg worse when you catch it? Yeah. Maybe not so much when I touch it. When I walk with it and I start flexing it, it doesn't like that. OK. OK. Just resting it right now. It feels fine. It's OK. OK. OK. Well, I'm going to, if I think of any more questions specifically about your leg, I will go back to it. But I'm going to move on. And ask you two questions about your overall health. You've already shared with me that you are diabetic. Do you have any other chronic conditions that you live with? On condition. See the family talk about cholesterol. If you want to pill for that. Had asthma as a kid. I'll talk about your initial know. And my back, I've had back pain for the last 10 years. But I don't know what it really takes for its Tylenol at build for that. Oh, my other question about your leg is, have you lost any feeling in it? No. It kind of like a doll egg sometimes when I touch it. But no, like in the area, the ankle, no. But definitely on my feet, like over the years, I've noticed. I feel less on it, and heard what I did previously. Yeah. OK. That makes sense. OK. So I talked to her. So we talked about diabetes. You said you have my cholesterol. So what medications are you currently taking? I'm taking four pills right now. One of them is for the cholesterol. I think it's called Rasuvistatin. The other three, they're all diabetes medications. But I don't remember. That form is one of them. Sit a slum. I have a list somewhere. I'll get that to you later. OK. Are you on insulin right now? No. Are you on any of these medications new? Do you have a reason? No. No. I've had to provide a year now. Do you have any allergies? Yeah, I do, actually. Kind of selling. Can't take that. And what happens when you take Ted as a villain? It's been a while as a kid. Apparently, like, face got loaded. It was just have a hard time breathing. So OK. Well, we'll make sure that we don't give you that. Can you tell me if you've had any previous surgery? Yeah. What was it? I had my sinuses. I had some pretty bad sinusitis when I was in my teens. And they went in kind of carved a little bit of space out. OK. OK. Is that the only surgery that you've had? Yeah. But. And can you tell me do you have any family history of diabetes, in problem, anything else that stands out to you? Yeah. I'm side of the family. Anyone who has diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol. That side of the family is pretty healthy. I think maybe one of my aunts had lung cancer, which is a pretty big smoke, too. And I'm hoping I'll do a few questions about your lifestyle. So you said that you have children? Yeah, I do. Do you live in town? Do you live with your kids? I live in town. I see my kids over two weeks. And what do you do for work that I already asked you this? No, I'm currently unemployed. I'm looking for work. Partially employed, I suppose. You should say, I work in my own business. I see. And what do you do when you are working ideally? When I have working, I'm going to count. OK. Cool. And you smoke? Yeah, once in a while. Yeah. I'm stressed, though. I think I've got an average. Last couple of weeks, I've been smoking more. Maybe like two packs a week. OK. Do you drink alcohol? Yeah. Yeah. How much do you typically drink? Average week. Maybe a two, four. So maybe like three per day or something like that? A few were to average it out? Yeah, if you average it out, I may only go through the two, four a weekend to be honest. Oh, I see. OK. More so on the weekend. So maybe a little bit more than three per day back in on those days. OK. Oh, I think that that's everything that's out. I need to ask you for now. I'd like to get a closer look at this leg. Did you have any other questions or concerns before we move forward with the floor of your pants? No, I just want to get this figured out. Yeah, we'll definitely do that for you. So I'm going to have a look at it. And then I'll show that I will go talk to the doctor that I'm working with. And we'll see what we can do for you. Is that sound good? Thank you, doc.

Uh right now I'm actually just living alone uh in an apartment. Okay um and do you smoke it all? No. Never I can't with uh with all this like training for yeah uh the race and stuff like that. Okay that's good. Uh any recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, eatin' with that before? No I never use anything like that in the past. Okay and how about alcohol? Uh rarely I'll have maybe an asoon like once every couple of months but it's pretty infrequent. Okay um all right so I just have a few questions uh um so right now over your right ankle. Do you have uh so you mentioned you don't have any swelling but do you notice any kind of uh redness or warmth at all? No nothing like that. Okay if you press down in your ankle does it hurt a lot? I a little bit of pain on it right um uh like outside but it's not uh uh wait it doesn't hurt that bad. So no it's not. Yeah I'll say no. Okay um and if you kind of uh uh are you able to uh move your ankle at all? I can yeah I can move it around a little bit I'm trying to avoid that though just because it does hurt but I can move it around. Okay and are you able to stand up and walk or uh are you not able to do that right now? I can yeah just short periods of time because it's uh just the pain but I can walk on it. Okay um yeah so definitely what we'll do is we might need to get like a proper physical examination done um to make sure there's no fracture. Most likely though it seems that this may just be an ankle sprain and due to you inverting your ankle the other day. What we can do is uh usually we just uh immobilize the ankle and then recommend applying ice um you can take some uh and says like add bill for pain to help you um and it should um it should uh get better on its own with some physiotherapy later on as well. However um if we find that on physical examination you are having a significant pain on palpation or any kind of bony pain we might also require you to get an x-ray of the right foot and ankle um as well as just your lower leg. So yeah we'll have you come come in in person and then go from there and see if you need an x-ray. Okay that sounds good thank you. All right let's take care.

{"text": "How may I help you? I just came in here today. I've been having a lot of shoulder pain that's just kind of left me not doing any of my activities recently. System or left shoulder. OK. And when did this pain start? It started five days ago. But it became pretty bad. And I've been kind of having like a somewhat of a pain for the last couple of weeks. But it got really bad just this week. OK. Did you have any trauma to this shoulder, like any injuries or triggers that could have caused the pain? I have been just going to the gym more frequently over the last few months, lifting weights, and things like that. But just this week I wasn't really able to do that either. OK. When you were lifting weights, like a few days ago, was there an episode where there was an acute onset of the pain? It got worse kind of right away. I think it was more progressive. But five days ago, I do feel that there was just I was having some pain before that. But then I just noticed all working. I started having more pain. But yeah, I don't think there was anything like sudden that happened though. OK. But yeah, I was progressing. And then it got acutely worse with the weight lifting. It sounds like. Maybe I did increase my weight in the last two weeks. So I did feel like a little bit more pain that increased last week. OK. I see. And in the left shoulder, do you feel the pain at the front that the sides or back? It hurts particularly in the front part of the shoulder. OK. Do you feel that it's radiating anywhere else? Just my whole left shoulder, nothing else really. OK. And could you describe the character or the quality of the pain? Is it sharp or is it achy? It's more achy. But certain, like some movements, it can get kind of sharp. OK. And has there been anything that has made the pain worse? If I just, if I carry anything with my left arm, or if I have to lift anything, or place it on my shoulder, like it really hurts. OK. And have you done anything that spayed it better? I just like resting it, not carrying anything and trying not to look behind on my shoulder. OK. So you're sleeping on the right side then? Yeah. OK. And what would you say the severity of the pain is on a scale of 1 to 10? If I'm not doing it, doing anything or not doing much, it's probably like a 2 or 3. But if I try to carry anything, it goes up to like probably like a 7. OK. And do you do any repetitive overhead activities, things like playing basketball, or just lifting things like above your head at the gym? Not recently. Just like normal weight exercises. Maybe with the bands, I do some overhead exercises. But in terms of sports, I used to play a lot of tennis. I did have some issues with the same shoulder, which is why I kind of stopped playing tennis. My doctor said I might have to open and use that shoulder. But that was like a couple of years back, so I thought it must have healed by now. OK. So previous overuse injury of the left shoulder. OK. And have you had any trauma to the shoulder? No, not that I know. OK. Have you had any fevers or chills? No. Have you had any night sweats? No. OK. Have you had any skin rashes or skin changes? No. OK. So even over the area, you haven't noticed any redness or soft tissue swelling? No. OK. Have you had any chest pain? Nope. OK. How about any shortness of breath? No, not that I've noticed. OK. Have you had pains in any other joints? No, just my shoulder. OK. And have you had any recent infections or symptoms such as like a runny nose or sore throat or even a cough? No, nothing like that. OK. And how about any nausea or vomiting? No. OK. And how has your sleep been the past couple of nights? So you mentioned you haven't been able to lay on your left side? Yeah, it's been pretty painful. I kind of wake up every time I accidentally go onto my left side. OK. Sorry. You're getting worse thing at pain at night. OK. Have you had any weakness? Do you feel like you have less strength than your arm? OK. I do feel that there might be some less strength than my left arm, but I'm not really using it much, so it's hard to tell. OK. And how about range of motion? Do you feel as though you could lift your left arm up to scratch your head and back? It does hurt when I try to lift my arm up. OK. So it sounds like range of motion is decreased. OK. And have you had an altered sensation of your arms being numbness or tingling? No. I haven't felt any of that. OK. And have you had any changes to your bowel habits, like constipation or diarrhea? No, nothing like that. Have you had any abdominal pain? No. And have you had any urinary problems? No. OK. And in the past, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions? No, I've been pretty healthy, actually. Just that overuse injury two years ago. OK. Great. And do you have any allergies to medications? No. OK. Do you take any medications regularly? Just recently, I've been taking a lot more of the hydro, but that's about it. OK. And have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries? No, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. OK. Could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently, like who you're living with and whereabouts? Yeah. So I'm living with my wife in a small condominium in downtown. OK. And are you working currently? Yeah, I'm working as a university agent. OK. And do you drink alcohol? Rarely, just on some occasions. That's about my goal, you know. OK. How about smoking cigarettes or cannabis? No, I'm never smoked. Do you use any recreational drugs or have you in the past? No. OK. And so the next part, just for that physical exam, so you have pain with shoulder abduction? Yes. Yes. So just, yeah, I do have some pain, especially from, yeah, pain throughout abduction. OK. Is there any pain that's parts of that range of motion that are more painful for you? Yeah, so probably from 60 degrees to 120 degrees, is more painful. OK. And if your arm is outstretched and you're thumb pointing down, so your arm is internally rotated, does that give you pain? OK. Um, yes. If, yeah, not just like that, but if you were to like press down on it, the internal rotation does cause a little bit of pain. OK. Um, OK. So it sounds like a positive job's test and a positive nearest test as well as a painful arc for your shoulder. And is there pain to palpation? Just, yeah, definitely just at the front of the shoulder, there's some pain over with palpation. OK. And sensation is normal, reflexes are normal. And strength is slightly reduced as well. OK. So that was everything that I wanted to ask on history and check, ask about on the physical exam as well. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention today that I may be forgot? No, I think that's it. OK. So based on the symptoms today, along with your age and prior history of an overuse injury of the left shoulder, it certainly raises concern of having an rotator cuff tear or a rotator cuff impingement syndrome where there is inflammation there and not necessarily actually a full tear of the muscle that's causing the pain. So those would be the two most likely things, yeah, the rotator cuff tear or subacromial impingement syndrome. And so we want to get an ultrasound of the left shoulder to evaluate the structures and possibly some other imaging, which is an X-ray or MRI to determine the extent of the injury in the left shoulder. OK. Sounds good. Thank you.", "metadata": {"filename": "MSK0010.mp3", "specialty": "Musculoskeletal", "confidence": 0.5, "word_count": 1405, "source": "medical_audio_dataset"}}

Maybe some other tests based on what we find out from there. And then we can kind of let you know after that what the next steps will be.

And where do you currently live? So I live in a house with my wife and son. OK. All right. And OK. So now I'm just going to move on to the physical exam part of this. And I'm going to ask you to do a few things. OK. So just by looking at your legs or if you have a mirror and you can look at your right buttock area, do you see any swelling or redness? No, I don't see anything like that. OK. And does it feel hot? No, it doesn't feel hot. OK. And do you see any skin changes? No skin changes. Any atrophy or deformity in the area? No. No. Has your date changed? Are you limping, hobbling, anything like that? Yeah, I feel like I've been limping a little bit. Yeah. Are you putting more pressure on the left foot then? I am. Yeah. Yeah. I guess it's like an entailed rigate. OK. All right. And then if you press down on your hip bone, do you feel any pain there on your right hip bone? No, I don't. OK. How about when you press down on your buttocks itself? I, yeah. There is a little bit of tenderness over the buttock area. OK. How about the back of your legs? No. How about there? OK. How about the front of your like size? No. No? OK. All right. And then I'm going to just get you to do a few movements with me as well. Would you ask, OK, so are you sitting down right now? Yeah. OK. Would you mind standing up from a sitting position? Yeah, for sure. Does that hurt? Yeah, that causes pain. OK. So that causes it. So on hip extension, that causes some pain. And as well as knee extension. So would you mind kicking your right leg up in front of you all the way up as far as you can go? Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. It does, yeah. So right hip flexion also causes pain. And then would you mind folding your knees backwards and just sort of flexing it? Does that hurt? No. OK. So no pain on knee flexion. And have a when you point your feet and toes up towards the ceiling. Yeah. Yeah. I do get some pain when my, yeah, when that's all straightened out. Yeah. OK. So some pain on plantar flexion at the right foot. And have it if you point your feet and toes towards the ground. No pain there. OK. All right. And have a when you kick your legs to the side and upwards. Oh, no pain with abduction. OK. So no pain on right hip abduction. And then how about when you bring it back down? No. OK. And no pain on hip abduction. OK. Well, those were all the questions that I have for you. Do you have any questions from myself? Just wondering about possibly like what it could be. Yeah. So it sounds right now like you may have some sort of a sacral nerve ridiculous epithee or like a lower lung bar ridiculous epithee. And basically that's known as sciatica where your nerve roots can become pressed causing some of these symptoms. And to diagnose these things, usually it's just done by history and physical exam. But if after we try out some management things, it doesn't go away or you're having some red flags, including numbness in the groin area, bowel or bladder and continents, then we can look at some imaging for the spine, including MRI. And so in terms of management of this, we can try a couple of like conservative approaches first. So that includes taking NSAIDs for the pain and then like activity modification. So if you're sitting down all the time, perhaps like taking little breaks, stretching out your legs, doing some physio as well during those breaks can help. And as well, I'm going to give you a referral for physical therapy. And they'll do some exercises with you and slowly increase those exercises. And if those still don't work, we can try steroids, steroid injections as well. We talked about the imaging if it doesn't go away in about six to eight weeks. Does that sound OK? Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. OK, yeah, no problem.", "metadata": {"filename": "MSK0006.mp3", "specialty": "Musculoskeletal", "confidence": 0.5, "word_count": 1687, "source": "medical_audio_dataset"}}
{"text": "45 year old female with right knee pain. Hi, my name is Chris. I'm a medical student in the clinics today. How may I help you? Hi, Chris. So I'm just having this pain in my knee since I just fell this three days ago slipping on the stairs. Since then I've been having a lot of pain. I see. So did this pain start right after falling on the stairs? Yeah, I've been having the pain since then. Okay. That was three days ago. Three years ago. Okay. And you're feeling the pain in your right knee? Yeah, in my right knee. Okay. And what would you say the character of the pain is, or how would you describe the pain? It's kind of like a dull, aging pain. Okay. And has the pain been getting any better or any worse? It's kind of getting worse, actually, just in my right knee, as well as my whole right calf as well. Okay. What is the intensity of the pain on a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you've ever felt? Probably around the six. Okay. And did your knee hurt before this at all? Or did you have any trauma to the leg before? No, no. Before three days ago, before my slip, I was fine. Okay. Are you feeling the pain anywhere else besides your right knee? In my calf, I'm getting a lot of pain as well in my right calf. Okay. Is there been anything that's made the pain worse? Yeah, if I am walking or if I'm moving that leg and putting weight on it, it's definitely worse. So it's definitely like better if I just stay seated and stay resting. Okay. Is there anything, excuse me, resting? Is there anything else that's helped? I did take some, which did help for a few hours, but then it just kind of ran back to the same. Okay. And have you had any associated symptoms with the right knee and calf pain? Yes, I also think there's some swelling in my right calf as well since yesterday. Okay. Okay. There's some swelling there. Have you noticed if your calf was red or if there was a rash over it? I don't see any rashes or redness, but it definitely does seem swollen and then it hurts as well when I move it or press it. Okay. And when you felt, did you injure any other parts of your body like your hands or wrists? Just a few scratches on my hands, but nothing too bad. And how about your head? Did you lose consciousness or hit your head? No, no, I didn't hit my head at all. I caught myself before then and no, I didn't lose any consciousness. Okay. Okay. Have you had any fevers or chills? No. Okay. Have you had any chest pain? No. Have you had any cough? No cough. Have you had any shortness of breath? No. Okay. Have you had any dizziness or lightheadedness? No. Okay. And have you had any heart palpitations or feeling like your heart is racing? No, nothing like that. Okay. And have you had any infectious symptoms such as like a runny nose or sore throat? No, nothing like that. Okay. And have you had any nausea vomiting? No. Have you had any abdominal pain? No. Okay. Have you had any changes to your bowel movements like diarrhea or more constipation? No. Nothing like that. All right. So have you had any urinary problems? No. All right. Have you had any recent weight changes? No. Nothing like that. Okay. And have you noticed any... It rashes anywhere else over your whole body? No, not that. I've noticed. All right. Have you noticed any muscle weakness? No. Have you had any numbness to the skin? No. Not that I've noted, no. And have you had any tingling? No. Okay. And... In the past, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions? I do have some high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I see. And do you take any medications? Yes. A cholesterol. I'm taking like a crestermedication. And then a high blood pressure I'm taking a ramopro. Okay. Have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries before? No. I... No, I don't... Just besides a... A C-section for one of my children. I don't have any other surgeries. Okay. And have you had any thrombosis before or a blood clot in the past? No. I've never had anything like that. Okay. And have you been... So you've had the birth of your... You had a C-section. And have you been pregnant other times in the past? No. That was it. Okay. So have you had a miscarriage before? No. Okay. Any allergies to medications? No allergies. Okay. And... Could you tell me a little bit about your... Living situation currently, like you're living with. Whereabouts are you living? Yeah, I live with my husband and our daughter. And it's just in a small townhouse just in the city. Okay. And are you working currently? I do work from home. I'm actually just... I'm in a counting clerk, but I'm also my work is from home right now. Okay. And any exposures to anybody who's been sick? No. Have you traveled anywhere recently? No. Okay. And over the last couple of days, with the leg pain, do you feel as though you've been like immobilized? Yeah. I've been trying to just stay rested, just stay seated, otherwise it hurts a lot, especially after my fall. So I've tried to stay immobilized. Okay. For the last couple of days. Okay. And do you drink alcohol? No. And do you smoke cigarettes? No. No. I don't. I don't. I don't. No, I don't. Okay. Okay. So... Oh, and in the family, are there any history of heart or lung conditions? So, don't know about heart or lung conditions, but my mother had a stroke in her late 60s. My father is pretty healthy. Okay. Has there been any blood clots in the family before? I'm not sure about blood clots, but my mother had a stroke. Is that kind of like a blood clot? It could be. I stroke can have many different types of causes for it, and one of them could be caused by a blood clot, but I wouldn't be able to say for sure, just because there are so many different types or reasons for having a stroke. Okay. So, yeah, so you mentioned your leg has some swelling. Do you feel as though there's any... Like temperature change to your calf? Like, is it hot? I think... I don't know if it's maybe a little bit warm, but definitely swollen. And do you feel... Is there any pain to palpation? Like, if you touch your calf or something like that, is there pain? Yeah, if I touch my right calf, it's painful, and then if I press down on it, it's really painful. And then just on the outside of my right knee, if I touch or press down, it really hurts as well. Okay. And if you move your foot, so if you dorsiflex your ankle, or bending your toe up towards your nose, do you end up getting any calf pain? It's doing that at the whole moment test? Yeah, I'll try that out. I think it definitely hurts when I move my... I don't know if I could point my toes towards my nose. Okay. Okay, so I think... That was everything that I wanted to ask today on history. Was there anything else that maybe I missed? No, I think that's all. Okay. All right, so with the fall two days ago, things that I'm thinking about right now would be possibly a muscle strain, so this could be a gastrocnemius strain to the calf muscle itself, from the fall, which could have pain when you touch it, it could be some swelling, and it would be aggravated by movements. Also could be injuries to some of the ligaments there, as well. And however, with the swelling, the immobilization for the last two days, as well as the pain kind of being a bit progressive, with swelling and a positive home and test, and your temperature is a little bit elevated today, not quite a fever, but feverish. It does increase the suspicion for a deep vein thrombosis. And so I think the most likely thing right now is actually a DVT or deep vein thrombosis. And so we will order some diagnostic studies and get an ultrasound of your right calf, as well as an x-ray of the right knee to start. Okay. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you so much.", "metadata": {"filename": "MSK0009.mp3", "specialty": "Musculoskeletal", "confidence": 0.5, "word_count": 1464, "source": "medical_audio_dataset"}}

{"text": "I was wondering if you could tell us what brought you into CS. Yeah, so I just came in and I was a bit worried because I've been having this cough for around two years, which has been getting worse. But recently I've noticed that I see streaks of blood in this put on that I'm producing before just used to be like white. And now I'm seeing over the last, I would say two months, occasionally, some streaks of blood. Okay. And the cough started two years ago. Yeah. Okay. And it's been gradually getting worse over that time. Yeah, I would say so. It's getting more frequent and worse in nature. Okay. And how much speed of are you bringing up in a day? Probably like a couple of teaspoons. Okay. And is are you seeing like bright red blood when you're when you're coughing it up? In this, it's kind of mixed into this put on, I would say like, but it definitely is red. Okay. And how much blood would you say that you're you're bringing up with the teaspoons or a cup or no, it's just like a little streaks. It's not really significant. It doesn't feel like the whole production of this put on, but just like little streaks that up knows this. Okay. And is the cough worse at any particular time of day? It definitely gets worse when I'm doing more activities. And then also when I get like some viral infections, but other than that, it's pretty much always there. Okay. Anything that makes it worse, I use it said some viral infections. You have you had a viral infection recently? Yeah. Like in the last two years, I've probably had two or three viral infections. This just cold, cold symptoms. Has there been anything that you've tried to make the cough better? I've tried the time cold. Has it really worked? Tried to just other over the counter medications haven't really worked? Okay. And prior to two years ago, were you experiencing any similar symptoms like this cough for bringing up blood before in the past? I've always had somewhat of a cough like I have COPD. Okay. So I've always had a little bit of a cough here and there, but over the last two years, I feel that it's been getting much worse. Okay. Have you been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis before? Yeah, I think so. Okay. And so with this cough and now blood tinged, have you been experiencing any other symptoms? I do feel sometimes I get like more tired than I used to throughout the day. Okay. Sometimes I also feel more breathless when I'm exerting myself more. Okay. And have you been having any fevers or chills? No, no, I haven't. How about any night sweats? No. Have you lost any weight? Yeah, I've actually lost a significant amount of weight I would say. But then the last one and a half month, probably lost like eight to ten pounds. Okay. Have you been trying to lose weight? No, not really. I've just been sitting around like I can barely walk that much anymore to I used to be able to walk at least 400 meters around the block. But now I can barely even go to the kitchen. Okay. Is this because of the shortness of breath when you are exerting? Yeah, that and I just start coughing so much that I just have to sit down. Okay. And have you been having any headaches? No headaches. All right. And how about and how's your appetite been? I think it's been pretty much the same. Sometimes I'm coughing a lot. I don't feel like eating, but I'm not that it's been around the same. Okay. Any nausea or vomiting? No. Any runny nose or sore throat? Nope. Okay. And then how about a loss of smell or a loss of taste? No, nothing like that. Okay. Have you been having any chest pain? No. Any heart palpitations? No. Any wheezing when you're breathing? Sometimes I would say like when when it gets worse when I'm exerting myself more, I can get some reason. Okay. And have you noticed any swelling in your feet or ankles? No, nothing like that. All right. And have you woken up at night extremely short of breath? No, I'm pretty fine during the night. All right. And have you been having any abdominal pain? No. Any urinary problems? No. Any bowel problems like diarrhea or constipation? No, nothing like that. All right. Any skin rashes? No. Any joint pains or muscle pains? No. Any weakness? Not weakness. I'll just say more fatigue. All right. So I know you told me COPD, but do you have any other medical diagnoses? Yeah, I have high blood pressure as well. All right. I think I have high cholesterol too. I see. Okay. Do you take any medications regularly? Yeah. So the cholesterol I'm taking, those overstats in. And I forget what I'm taking for the blood pressure, but it's pretty well under control. Okay. You use any inhalers for COPD? I used to, I used to have, I think like three different inhalers, but haven't had to use them for two more than 10 years now. Okay. What was the reason for not needing them anymore? I just didn't have any symptoms for a pretty long time. And my docs said like, if I don't really need them, then I can just stop. Okay. And have you had any recent hospitalizations? No. Any allergies to medications? Nope. Any surgeries that you've had in the past? No surgeries. Okay. And are your vaccinations up to date? Yep. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about your social situation or living situation? Yeah. So currently I'm just living by myself in an apartment. I've been there for more than 10 years now. I'm retired, so I'm not working anymore. Yeah, that's me. Okay. Great. What did you do previously for work? Did you have any exposures for two chemicals or dusts or asbestos? Things like that nature? Oh, yes. So I worked in the steel factory for most of my working life. I think there might have been some exposures to chemicals and dust particles. Asbestos, I don't think there was exposure, but definitely I may have lived in places that had asbestos. Yeah. Okay. How long have you been living where you've been now? So this is like the one I'm living in as a new place, but before that, I've lived in another apartment for around five years, and that was a pretty old building. Okay. Do you have any pets? No pets, no. Okay. Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes? Yeah, I smoke, I'll say, around 20 cigarettes a day right now. All right. And did you smoke more previously? Yeah, I think I've been smoking for almost like 40 years now, and I used to smoke up to 30 cigarettes a day. Okay. Do you smoke cannabis? No. All right. And do you drink alcohol? Just maybe a couple of times a month. No, nothing, nothing throughout the week. Okay. So do you use any recreational drugs like IV drugs or opioids or co-sale? No, nothing like that. All right. And anybody in the family have any similar symptoms before, like coughing up blood or I know, not that I know my father passed away from a heart attack when he was in his 60s. And I think my mother had, like, I think one of the, like an arthritis. Yeah. But I think that was just like the one that you get with old age. Okay. Like, osteoarthritis? Yeah, that was the one. Okay. Any cancers in the family? Um, not that one of my own cause has like a bladder cancer, but that's that's about it. Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently or been around any sick contacts? Possibly people, anybody who's had tuberculosis or any infections? No, I've been pretty much to myself over the last few months, so not really. Okay. Um, was there anything that you were worried that this could be? Uh, yeah, just the blood, I kind of got scared, maybe I thought, you know, what if it's a cancer? Um, one of my friends had lung cancer. And I know I've been smoking for most of my life, so that's something I was worried about. Um, I can certainly see the the concern and I understand where you're coming from. Um, I think it would be very reasonable to investigate that today. Um, so we'll start with, um, uh, HSCT, um, along with, uh, some lab work, you'll get a CBC and some electrolytes. Um, also get an ECG as well if they just check your heart. And, um, we will, uh, see what the investigations show. Sounds good. Okay. And, um, other things that, uh, to think about, um, this could be, uh, also, like the COPD, uh, I know it's been going on a long time, but, um, possibly could have a pneumonia that's been lingering on, particularly if it's a fungal type of, uh, infection as well as, um, things like you mentioned, you possibly unsure if you've had an asbestos exposure in the past and stuff like that can possibly lead to, um, scarring of the lung.

{"text": "My back is just really hurts. I feel really stiff in the morning. And yeah, it's just been going on for a few months now. Okay, so for a few months, stiffness in the morning. So your back hurts, where exactly would you say it hurts? It kinda hurts all over. I can't really pinpoint any specific locations that hurt most. It kinda hurts all down my back. Okay, all the way up to, I guess, your neck and all the way down to your lower back. I wouldn't really say the neck. I guess more of the lower parts, maybe the middle of my back and down. Okay, and what kind of pain would you say it is? Is it like a dull aching pain? Is it a sharp stabbing pain? How would you describe it? It's a dull pain. Dull pain, okay. And on a scale of 0 to 10, would there be an elis amount of pain you felt in your life and 10 being the worst? How much would you rate it? It's about a four or five. I mean, some days it can be better, but, yeah, some days it can be worse. Okay. And when did this start? I think this started about four or five months ago. It's been going on, yeah, for probably about half a year now. Okay. And when it first started, was there anything that caused the back pain, like any kind of trauma or injury, anything that you can think of that might have led to this? No, nothing that I can think of. It's sort of, it's come on so slowly, like when I first started noticing the back pain, it was maybe like a zero to a one. I didn't really notice it too much, but over these last five, six months, it has gotten a bit worse. Okay, so it kind of came on progressively. It didn't just come on suddenly at some point. Right, yeah, it's been getting worse. Okay. And have you ever had any previous episodes that are similar to this? Not my back pain. I do get pain in my right knee and in my hands sometimes, but those pains just kind of come and go. Okay, when did those pains start? Those ones started probably, ever similar timeline around six months ago. Okay. Okay, and the back pain that you're having, does it radiate or move to any other part of your body? No, I don't feel it anywhere else. Okay, and have you tried anything that has helped relieve some of the pain in medications or anything? Yeah, I've tried some Tylenol and Advil and the Advil's actually helped taking the adjocl a little bit, but the next morning, I have the stiffness and pain again. Okay. And for your pain, are there any kind of factors that make the pain worse, like bending down or standing straight up or laying down anything that makes your pain worse? No, nothing that I can think of that really makes it any worse. Okay. And is your pain worse when you wake up in the morning or is it worse as the day progresses? It's worse in the morning. It gets a bit better as the day goes on. I ask you about an hour into the day, I feel my best. It takes a little bit of time to move around a little bit first. Okay, and approximately how much time would you say after you wake up the stiffness and pain goes away? I would say maybe 30 to 60 minutes. Okay. All right. And you haven't had any trauma injuries in recent years? No trauma or injuries. Okay. And no fevers or chills? No. Okay. Any night sweats? No. Any fatigue or malaise? Yeah, I have been a bit more fatigue than usual. And yeah, I've had some malaise as well. And for how long have you had this? It's been similarly getting a little bit more progressive. I mean, some days I'm just feeling like I just want to lay around and rest because I'm feeling just so burnt out and other days I'm okay, but I'm certainly more tired than usual. Okay, let's see. Other than that, have you noticed any kind of rashes or skin changes or changes in your nails at all? No. I haven't noticed any rashes or any nail changes. Okay. Any shortness of breath?

I have a girlfriend and we started dating about six months ago. Okay. And do either of you have any history of any STIs at all? No history of STIs. Okay. All right. And is your partner fine or is she having any symptoms at all? No, she hasn't been having any symptoms and we've been using a condom mostly. Okay. Right. And otherwise, are you generally healthy or do you have any medical conditions? Yeah, I'm generally, I do have asthma actually. And just I had diarrhea a few months ago after eating at a buffet. So I think maybe it was food poisoning or maybe something like that. But yeah, so asthma and that's it. And do you use any medications for your asthma? Yeah, I'll use the blue inhaler. Sometimes I guess the just when I need it. But that hasn't been very often. Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications or any environmental factors? I do have environmental allergies.

Did she ever have any control? Did she have all kinds of psoriasis? I don't believe so. I think she had just issues with her skin. Okay. And so you work and then what's her living situation? Yeah. So I live with my girlfriend in a condo in the city here. Okay. And do you use any rectory food drugs like marijuana? Yes, sometimes. Yeah, I also smoke at once or twice per week with a friend or something like that. Okay. And do you smoke? No cigarettes, no. Never. Okay. And do you drink alcohol? Sometimes you all have a beer two on weekends or a cocktail with friends. Okay. All right. So those were just some of the questions I had. Now I'm just going to quickly ask some specific questions. So have you noticed any kind of swelling in the areas that you are having pain or redness or anything like that? No, I haven't noticed really any redness or swelling. Okay. And no. So are you able to bend down and stand up straight or extend backwards without pain or are you in any pain? Okay. I do get a bit stiff. I... Yeah, I'm not really too sure. Like not really. It's more stiff. Okay. And yeah, other than that, do you have any questions or concerns? Yeah, I was just wondering. Yeah, like what this could be possibly? Yeah, so definitely what... So this seems like it started of like three months to six months ago and it's been going on and it's happening in the morning. How old did you say you were? I'm 2026. Okay. Yeah, so in a team's progressive and you're getting some pain and your other joints as well. And it's mainly from your middle to lower back. It can be multiple things that you would have to rule out. So first you have a family history of psoriasis so it can be psoriatric arthritis. You don't have any other skin changes or any other symptoms. It can also be since you have had a... You were sick four months ago with what might be gastroenteritis. It can be... Sometimes a few months afterwards you can get something called the active arthritis where you get this progressive pain and your joints and stiffness. And otherwise it can also be something called enter losing spondylitis which can present in your age and it's kind of like a progressive doll back pain and that has some morning stiffness as well. So yeah, there's definitely multiple things that it can be. So first we would need to do a full physical examination and book an appointment for that in person. And we'll get some lab work done as well as an x-ray of the spine and your sacral aliac joints. And we'll also get some blood work with CBC, CRP and ESR. So those are just inflammatory markers as well as the rheumatoid factor and can you clear antibodies. So there's just some things that will test for a different kind of rheumatoid-logical issues and to see if you have any arthritis. So yeah, those are... And then we'll also get an x-ray of your hands and knees since you're having pain there as well. So yeah, those are some steps that will take... Do you have any questions or things, James? No, that sounds great. Thank you. All right, yeah. So we'll get in touch with you shortly. Sounds great. Thank you. All right, take care. All right.

{"text": "what brings in here today? Yeah, yeah, last night. So having this pain in my right wrist, yeah, last night I tripped over something and I ended up landing on my hand to help break the fall. And this morning I woke up and I had some bruising on my hand and it's really sore to touch it. Okay, which hand is this? It's my right hand. Okay, and when you had your fall, when was your fall? So it was last night, probably like 10 pm, something like that. What out with a few friends for dinner and drinks? Okay, and do you remember how high you felt from or what you fell on to? Yeah, I was standing high. We were just kind of walking down the street and tripped over something on the curb. I think there was a like a poddle or something like that. And so I felt right onto the concrete with my hand. Okay, did you hit your head at all or lose consciousness? No, nothing like that. Okay, so it was mainly your hand that got injured. Yeah, it was mostly my hand. Okay, and are you having any pain on movement or if you press on it? Yeah, I do get some pain paying if I'm trying to move the wrist around and it hurts if you press on it as well. Okay, and do you notice any kind of swelling or bruising? I do, yes, they're swelling and bruising. Okay, and if you had to describe where the swelling and bruising and the pain are, how would you describe it? So I have a sharp pain right at my wrist, I feel it mostly at the base of my thumb kind of right at the wrist. And that's where the swelling and bruising is as well. Okay, and is it right under your palm or at the back of your hand on the wrist? At the back of the hand at the wrist and base of the thumb. Okay, okay. All right, and what kind of pain are you feeling is this sharp, is it dull, aching? Oh yeah, it's really sharp, it feels like sorry, it's stabbing me in the hand. Okay, and how much would you rate the pain on the scale of zero to 10, 10, being the worst pain you've felt in your life? If I'm not moving it around, it's a three, but if I move it, it goes up to like a nine on a 10. Oh, okay. And is it radiating or moving anywhere else on to your hand? No, I don't feel it anywhere else. Okay, and do you have any kind of pins and needles sensation, tingling or numbness anywhere in your hands? No, nothing like that. Okay, anything that makes the pain worse or better? Yeah, I tried some AT and flammatories, I did help with taking the edge off a little bit. But the pin just came right back and then also, like just moving it at all. It's even texting on my phone was really bugging me. Okay. Yeah, so you definitely, you went to, you had the fall yesterday or? Yeah, it was yesterday. Okay. Okay. All right. So when did it start hurting? Did it start hurting right away or has it gone worse at all? Yeah, it started hurting right away and it's, well, this morning it's a bit worse, yeah. Okay. Do you have any other symptoms at all? Like fever, chills, headache, anything like that? No. Any dizziness or feinting? No. Okay. Any diarrhea, constipation? No. Any changes in your vision, hearing, balance? No, nothing like that. Okay. But yeah, so your main concern today is this pain in your wrist? Yeah, exactly. Okay. All right. And do you have any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with? Yeah, I do. I have asthma and I use an orange inhaler. It gave me, and it's in well controlled. I'll use, I would use the blue one in a while. Okay, so it's pretty well controlled. Yeah. And do you take any other medications at all? I just did a multivitabin. Okay. And vitamin D as well. Okay. All right. And have you been hospitalized in the past or had any surgeries? Yeah, I have a ton of blood. If I was the teeth out when I was a teenager and, or tonsils when I was a kid, actually. And it's a second. Okay. Sun. Okay. Any complications at all with that at all? No, no. Every, every, that was okay. Okay. And have you injured your right hand or broken any bones before? No, I haven't. Okay. So this is the first injury on your right hand. Okay. And do you have any family history of any medical conditions at all? Yeah, my, my uncle died of a heart attack when he was at his 60s. I think my grandfather also had a heart attack as well. Yeah, that's what it is. Okay. And in terms of your work, do you do, do you work currently? Yeah, I do. I work in a restaurant. And so this will be difficult for my job coming up with an injured rest. I, and, and hand, I just restarted and I'll have to be carrying a lot of different things. And so I just hope it's not broken. Oh, I see. Yeah, it might definitely, and that might be concerning. You know, we'll get that track though on X-ray and everything. But we just need to do a few, few more questions and some examination as well. How would you describe your living situation right now? So I'm living, I'm actually in an apartment. Okay. And do you currently smoke? No, I've never smoked. I couldn't with having asthma. So I just did it away from home and that. Okay. And do you drink alcohol? Yeah, I do. I have a couple of bottles of wine per week. Okay. All right. A couple of bottles a week. So how much would you have in an average day? Oh, I guess probably like two or three glasses a one a day. Okay. Yeah. So we definitely recommend for women to limit themselves to maybe one to two max two glasses of one. And then we'll have wine a day as it can have health effects in the future in terms of drinking and then on your liver. Okay. And other than that, I just had a few questions. Any recreational drugs like marijuana? No, stay away from that as well. Okay. Okay. So I'm just going to ask a few questions about specifically to examine your rest. So you notice, so can you are you able to move your wrist around? Are you able to make a fist? I can, but I can't really bend my thumb. And it hurts a lot. So I can bend my fingers, but my thumb's kind of out. Okay. Do the joints in your thumb hurt at all? No. Okay. And any pain anywhere else like on your fingers or your elbow? No. Okay. And what movement would you say hurts the most? Um. Probably just moving the the wrist like flexing and extending the wrist. Okay. And where this following you said is at the base of the thumb, right? Yeah, exactly. At the base of the thumb on the on the back of the hand, there are some neck bruising and swelling there. Okay. Is it warm at all to touch? No, it doesn't feel warm. Okay. Um. Okay. And if you press on, uh, are you getting any, uh, bony pain in that area? Like if you put press on a bone? Yeah. Like I mean, if I, there's one spot that if I press down, um, it, it's like 10 of the 10 pain, it hurts really bad if I, uh, press at the base of my thumb there. Okay. All right. So those are all the questions I had for you today. Um, uh, we definitely need to, uh, since you're having, uh, pain on just puppy, puppy in the area, they're swelling, redness, and you did have a fall and you landed on your, um, you caught yourself with your hand. There is a common, uh, fracture that can happen in those circumstances, uh, um, to your wrist. And so we need to do an x-ray. And, um, we will see if you have a fracture or not, but we also need to, um, see if we need to get a cast for you or, uh, if, um, making an interior, um, injury with, um, a, a splint or, and then based on what we see in your physical examination, we'll determine how long you need to be in the cast or splint, um, and then, uh, walk off from there.

{"text": "I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in. Yeah, so like a couple months ago, I was in the office and they told me that I've asked not like I had it when I was a little kid and I thought I grew out of it. But apparently not or like it came back or something. So, um, yeah. So they just told me to come back today. I don't really have like any issues. Okay. So, um, what what brought on the appointment in the summertime or a couple of months ago? So like I have gym class at school and my teacher just always saw it. Like I should be able to run faster. Like I'm like a good athlete, but I just could go much faster. And then like saying, I can't really breathe when I'm running that fast. And then you know, my mom is like, you should probably go and she'll probably make an appointment. Okay. And when you're exercising or in gym class, do you get short of breath? Or do you find that you have difficulty breathing? Yeah, yeah. Like I try to run fast. Kind of can't breathe anymore. So I kind of stop or go slower. Okay. And how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away? Look if I stop doing like the thing I'm doing it. I don't know. Not very long. A couple of minutes. Okay. And does this happen in any other settings? Sometimes when it's really cold outside, I'll go out and like my chest feels tight and feel like I can't breathe. And kind of sucks. Like when girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow angels and stuff and I couldn't do it. Oh, and another time like I went to my friend's house and they had like a bunch of cat. I felt like that weasy sound and I thought like that time it took longer for the breathing to get easier that I had to leave. Okay. So you've noticed changes to your breathing sounds like you've had noisy breathing before? Yeah, mostly just with the cat. Okay. We don't have a cat at my house. So I didn't really think anything of it. And then I went to my friend's house who had a bunch of cats. And at that time I could actually hear it. No, okay. And have you had a cough? No, I don't think so. Okay. And were there anything, was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away? Like I have the inhaler that the doctor gave me last time. So, so yeah, like I've been using that in gym class now. Okay. How many days per week are you using that? Yeah. Well, I'm a little confused now because I, the one I'm supposed to use like every day a couple of times and then there was a different one that I thought it was only supposed to be used if the other one didn't work. But now the nurse just told me that I'm supposed to use them both. So I only got the one at the pharmacy. So I don't really, I don't really know. I feel like a bit confused now. But I always use the one, both to be like two times a day, so I'm sorry to the nap. But sometimes I just do it one today if I forget the second one. Okay. Well, we could definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today. Sometimes for steroid medications, those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximum benefit. And so we'll take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and how often you're needing it. Have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at night time? Oh, no. Mostly like gym pasta, like I said. Okay. And have you had any other associated symptoms? I don't think so. Like what do you mean? So anything like allergies, like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like eye tearing? When I was around the cat, yeah. But not the other time. Okay. And do you ever have any rashes on your skin or really itchy skin? When I was a kid, but not really now. Okay. And how about any nausea or vomiting? No. You're okay. Any infectious symptoms overall? Hey, I don't think so. Okay. Any urinary problems? Uh, like, no. Okay. Um, any bowel problems? I don't know. No, that's all good. Okay. And any fevers or chills? Uh, no. Okay. And then how about having any night sweats? What's that? Uh, so overnight when you're sleeping, you'd wake up with either your, like pajamas, drenched or your, your sheaths drenched, drenched from sweating? Oh, no. Okay. I'm not that. Okay. So I just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health. Have you been, so you mentioned asthma? Uh, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions? Uh, no, no, that's it. Okay. Um, and any recent hospitalizations? Hmm. Like, I broke my leg years ago, but like, that was just like really fast. Okay. Uh, any surgeries? Uh, just like my wisdom teeth. Okay. And, um, any medications? These side, like, including the, um, inhalers? Uh, nothing else. Just those things and my mom makes me take a vitamin. Okay. And any allergies? Uh, well, I don't know. I like not that I thought, but maybe like cash. Okay. And do you have any six, like, seasonal allergies? Do you find like, in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get some, uh, like dry eyes or really itchy eyes or runny nose? Uh, yeah, I was just not like I had a cold, but I guess like I usually feel like that in the spring time. Okay. Um, and, uh, are your immunizations up to date? Uh, I think so. Like I've had all the stuff that I'm, that I'm supposed to do, I think, I don't know the names of everything. Okay. And, uh, so actually, I just wanted to ask a few questions about, uh, personal and kind of lifestyle habits, but, uh, first I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation. Yeah, like I love with my mom and dad and, uh, my little brother. Uh, okay. Yeah. Okay. And, uh, where do you go to school? Um, to, to the school, not like high school down the road. Okay. And it will grade now. Um, I'm in grade 11. Okay. And, uh, what types of, um, uh, like hobbies or kind of activities are you interested in? Uh, like I like playing video games. Um, I was really wanting to, uh, join the Marines and I was really trying to get into that stuff. Yeah, but then I heard like you can't, when you have asthma. Uh, so I kind of want to know about that. Like is that going to stop me from doing that? Yeah. So it's something that, um, we'll, we'll look into today. I'm not too sure what the details are, uh, um, regarding that information, but thank you for bringing that up and we'll be, uh, for sure to look into that together. Um, and that reminded me of a question I wanted to ask earlier. Um, and so have you had pulmonary function tests, uh, done before? Uh, what is that? So, um, essentially they'll have you kind of breathing into a tube, um, where you'll have, uh, periods where you'll maximally inhale and then, uh, maximally exhale as quickly as you can. Uh, you'll do different, um, types of, uh, breathing, uh, movements so that it gets measured on a, on a device. Oh, like, is that like when you breathe in the tube? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, like the last time I was here, like, probably a month ago, I did that and he said that my asthma was back. Okay. Thank you for clarifying. Um, and so, uh, so for the last few questions about, um, uh, the personal habits I was wondering, I understand that people, um, in your age group, might experience with smoking or, or alcohol, do any of your friends do that? Uh, I mean, sometimes we'll drink beer like at parties on the weekend. I don't, I don't drink a lot. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about your death? Sorry, I missed that. Um, there's just one, I wonder, uh, can you tell me a little bit about your diet? Oh, uh, well, I'm always, um, like makes me, uh, a lunch, like I'll have like a sandwich for lunch. Like, you know, ham and cheese or something. We usually have like, cereal for breakfast. I'm all mixed in, and I usually like, meat and like, potatoes and vegetables or something. And I think it's like pretty normal. Okay. Um, and, uh, are you currently sexually active? Uh, uh, like I have a girlfriend, um, like just with her, uh, like this recently. Yeah, we started. Okay. And, um, do you use a condom? Yeah. Yeah. Every time or, um, sometimes. Oh, yeah, every time. It's nothing at many times, but yeah. Okay. Great. And, um, have you had any other partners? Oh, no, no, like I had made out with other people before, but this is like the first one. Okay. Have you had us actually transmitted infection before? Uh, no. Okay. And, um, I know this, uh, question might seem, um, a little bit invasive, but it's important to ask everybody. Um, have you had any thoughts of hurting or harming yourself? No. Okay. I have it. Okay. Great. Um, and, uh, in, in your family, has anybody ever had any of these similar symptoms before? Uh, like my, my dad, I think he maybe had us when he was younger, but like he doesn't really have it now. Okay. Uh, and any allergies that run in the family? Hmm. Like my, my dad also, my dad gets like a runny nose in the spring. So, yeah, I think that's allergies. Okay. Um, so overall, it's, it's sounding like, um, even having this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing episodes that you're saying that it's made worse when you're exercising out in the cold. And then around pets and sometimes when the season changes as well in the spring and so, and then, um, with a recent diagnosis on, pulmonary function tests a few months ago. Um, so I think it would be important to, uh, clear up the medications today and try to get that, um, better organized moving forward because it sounds like you're still pretty symptomatic, um, with needing to use them. Um, daily, currently. And so, uh, we'll look into that and then also the question about, uh, the marine, um, um, interest with, uh, asthma. Yeah. Thank you. I really want to know that. Like that was my plan and now I'm kind of worried I can do that. Excellent. Okay.

Okay, so the first thing here would be like vital signs and assessing kind of stability. So is there... So we're going to save White. That information. We're going to save White. Stable, he is on to leaders of oxygen right now. Okay, so when did the symptoms, specifically start? Two days ago. Okay, and what started first?

I guess last month, he kind of had similar symptoms, and they said it was a viral infection. So he was just giving some puffers to help us breathing, and he got better on his own. Okay, did they tell you what the diagnosis was? At that time, we're just saying that it was a viral infection. No, they said it could be broncholitis or just an upper viral infection. Okay. Okay. Any reasons for hospitalizations? That time that he had the broncholitis or viral infection, he was hospitalized for two days just to help his breathing. Okay. And any medications that he takes regularly or uses regularly? Uh, he, no, no. Okay, any allergies to medications that you're aware of? No. Okay. And in regards to berthic or prenatal history, were there any complications throughout pregnancy? No, I wouldn't say so, no. It was normal. Everything was normal and he was a healthy baby. Okay.

Um, and, uh, in the family, are there any, uh, lung conditions like asthma or, um, any heart conditions that run in the family? Um, my sister, so has Aunt, has asthma. Okay. Um, and, uh, does anybody, um, is there any congenital diseases that run in the family? No. Okay. How about any genetic diseases? No. Okay. Um, and, um, so, um, it's sounding like, um, we wanted to do a, uh, a workup for, um, his symptoms right now for breathing heavily and, uh, with the fever that's concerning for, uh, a type of infection and with being under three months, um, it would warrant, uh, some, investigations. So we'd want to check, so do some blood tests, um, uh, and check, um, his cerebral spinal fluid as well to make sure that there's no infection. Um, and, and in the brain, I guess, and, um, we'll kind of go, go from there. Sure. Yeah. That sounds good. Okay. Um, in the meantime, yeah, we'll give you some, um, inhalers and keep the oxygen on to help, with the lungs, um, in the breathing and then keep, um, monitoring for, um, uh, how he's doing, uh, symptomatically. Okay. Thank you. Uh, you're welcome. Were there any, uh, was there anything else that I, uh, missed the task about? I know. I don't think so. Okay. Oh, that sounds good. So if there was nothing else that you wanted to share, um, we'll get that started and, um, um, I'll, I'll be back shortly. Okay. Sounds good.

I've had a sore throat now for a couple of weeks, and it's just not going away. Couple of weeks? OK, so about two weeks, three weeks? Yeah, about two to three weeks. OK. What does it feel like? Is it kind of like a burning feeling? Is it more like an itchy feeling? What does it feel like? I would say it's kind of, yeah, like burning or or scratchy. OK. And does it hurt when you swallow? It does, yeah. When my throat hurts when I'm eating or swallowing it, like liquid as well, but cold stuff seems to make it feel a little bit better. OK, good. And does your neck hurt too? A little tender. I've noticed the some lumps at the front of my neck that have been a bit sore. OK. And is it mostly sore kind of like midline or is it more sore to one side versus the other? Maybe the right side is a little bit more sore, but I can feel it on both sides of my neck. OK. And how bad would you say your discomfort is one to 10, 10 being the worst? I would say maybe a two or three. If I move my neck, I can feel it more, but otherwise it can just barely notice that it's there. OK. So it's not preventing you from sleeping, going to school, playing, things like that. No, it's more so the sore throat when swallowing. OK. OK. Have you noticed a fever at all? I have. Yeah, I felt hot and I checked my temperature this morning and it was 38.7. I think it was. Is that a fever? Yeah, I'd say that's a fever. We can also do another temperature check today. OK.

How big is it? Is it more than a centimeter? Uh-huh. Yeah, it's pretty well. I mean, it's kind of spread out over an area. It's not all continuous, I guess. You can kind of see patches or blockages.

Like was this before the sore throat or after? I can't remember the onset. I think the sore throat started first and the rash came a little bit later. OK. OK. And have you noticed that your glands are swollen? I think so. Maybe that's what's swollen in my neck. OK. OK. How about coughing? No, I haven't had a cough. No. And how about a stepy nose or a runny nose? Nothing like that. OK. Body aches. Yeah, it felt some muscle aches, for sure. OK. Upper limbs or lower limbs? I'd say a kind of whole body.

It might be a little bit down. I just haven't been feeling so great. So I'm probably eating less the last few weeks. Yeah. Have you been around anyone who may have been sick recently? Yeah, actually, I think a few of my friends, or there was somebody in my gym class who decided they had similar symptoms. OK. OK. And when was this? Now I think about it. Probably about three or four weeks ago. OK. And were they ever treated for that? Did they see a doctor? I'm not sure. No. OK. No worries. I just remember them being off for school because they were sick. OK. Yeah. Any issues with your eyes? No. No. Nothing like crusting or pus coming out of your eyes, red eye, anything like that. No. No, they have looked to me a little bit more red than usual, but I haven't noticed anything in terms of itching is or discharge. OK. Any nausea or vomiting? No, no, no nausea or vomiting. OK. How about your stool? Have they been normal? Have you had diarrhea, constipation, anything like that? Those no changes to your bowel habits. OK. How about urine? That's been OK. OK. OK. Have you ever had these symptoms before? I mean, I've had sore throats in the past, but not while feeling like this, though. Yeah. OK. When was the last time you had a sore throat? I don't know. Maybe when I was a kid. OK. It's been a while. Yeah. Like a strep throat kind of thing, more or more viral. Yeah. I do remember getting antibiotics when I was younger. OK. OK. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any medical conditions? I was diagnosed with asthma. OK. And are you on any medications for that? Yeah. So I just use Ventilin as needed, but otherwise. Oh, and then I take flow vent daily. So. OK. I think that's the one. There's a couple of inhalers that I take. OK. OK. And any other medications? Sometimes I'll take like reactin or some other type of allergy pill, but that's it. OK. What are you allergic to? Well, I would say mostly seasonal allergies. But yeah, seasonal allergies and dust, maybe. OK. And are you up to date with all your immunizations? Yeah. My mom makes me get the flu shot every year. OK. Good. And OK. Have you seen another doctor for the symptoms at all? Have you been worked up for that? Any blood work testing done for it already? No, I thought I would have felt better by now. And so I haven't seen anybody, but it's kind of just been going on now and not seeming to get better. So I want to come see somebody. Yeah, for sure. Have you tried anything for your symptoms, any medications, anything over the counter? Yeah, I've had some Tylenol. And I think what is it, Advil? And the devil is helped with some of the kind of aches and pains, but they've come right back. OK. Any family history of lung issues, heart issues? No, nothing like that. No. Yeah. OK, have what cancers? I think my grandfather had a pancreatic cancer. OK. OK. All right. So you live at home, correct? Yeah, I live with my parents and my younger sister. She's 12. She's 12. Is she healthy? Yeah, she is. OK. Good. And have you guys traveled recently? No, we've been at home. OK. OK. And do you smoke? No, I don't smoke. No. How about marijuana? I've tried it once or twice, but just those couple of times. Nothing that I do or use regularly. OK. And how about alcohol? No, no alcohol. No alcohol. OK. Are you sexually active? No, I'm not. No, OK. Is there a possibility that, or actually, sorry, I should repeat this, that have you kissed anyone recently? I guess I kind of have a girlfriend now that I started hanging out with about two months ago. OK. OK. And so I guess yes. OK. All right. Well, that's good. Um, I have, how she had any of these symptoms? Well, she wasn't feeling well for a while back, but I don't think it was this bad for her. OK. And she's better now? Yeah, she's better now. OK. All right. So you mentioned your loss actually active. If you were to be, make sure you use protection. And OK. So everything at home is OK then. No one's sick at home, you mentioned, right? Yeah, no one's sick at home. OK. And school is going OK? All right. Yeah, school's been going OK for the most part. It's been tough days. Last few weeks feeling like this, though. Yeah, for sure. And are you and your girlfriend in an exclusive relationship? I think so, yeah. OK. I asked because there's something called what you may be familiar with and it's called the Kissing Disease in medical terminology. It's called Mono as caused by a virus called EBV. So it could be that, though. We're covering all our bases. Oh, I've heard of Mono before. Yeah. OK. It's likely I could be up there in terms of what you have. So I think those were all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions for me? Anything you wanted to add? No, I think that's you cover everything. OK. All right. So we'll go off a few. We'll try to cover our bases and get you tested for Mono, which you'd have to do like a Mono spot test. And we can do a rapid test as well. This EV has something called Streptro. But yeah, we'll see what those results come back as and we'll go from there. Does that sound good? Yeah. No, that sounds good. OK.

Is there any other questions or concerns that you have or something that may have missed to ask you today? No. I don't think so. Okay. So based on what we talked about from your swelling as well as breathlessness while laying down in your past history of a heart attack and high cholesterol, it may be likely with the medications you're on as well as your history that you might be having what's called a congested heart failure. So we will need to do further investigations to determine if that is what it is and if we need to get you on something like like a laxics or a diuretic to get rid of some of the fluid that's building up in your body which may be caused by a heart failure. So we'll do some investigations and then go from there.", "metadata": {"filename": "CAR0003.mp3", "specialty": "Cardiology", "confidence": 0.5, "word_count": 1251, "source": "medical_audio_dataset"}}

No shaking or sweaty bed. Okay. And how about like that stuff he knows or runny nose? No, nothing like that. Okay. And coughing? No cough. So is he complaining of any body aches? No, it's mostly just been his throat that he's complaining about. Okay. How about headaches? He hasn't mentioned anything with his head. And has he been around anyone who's been sick maybe at his daycare? I mean, his sister has had some colds. She's also in his daycare. So, I mean, maybe her? Okay. How old is she? She's two. Okay. So she's younger. Yeah. Okay. Any nausea or vomiting? No vomiting. Okay. How about diarrhea, constipation? How would you notice anything like that? His valvements have been normal? How about urinating? Has that been normal? His usual amount as far as I know. Okay. Any issues with his eyes, any, like, pus or bleeding or redness? No, his eyes have looked normal to me. Okay. How about his ears? Those have also been normal. Okay. Any sores on his mouth or inside? No, it does kind of look like they're, like it's pretty red in the back of his throat when I was able to look. But, uh, yeah. Okay. And has he ever experienced any of these symptoms before? He's had sore throats before, but I think this one is a bit more severe. He hasn't complained this bad before. Okay. Okay. Has he tried anything for it? Have you given him any over the counter medications? Yeah, we did use some Tylenol and it brought the fever down. So, that was part of the reason why we didn't come to end because he's had sore throats before, but, uh, the fever bounced back and, and the pain seems to, um, have continued. So, uh, we came in. Okay. Um, and does he, is he otherwise healthy? Does he have any medical conditions? Uh, yeah. He's otherwise healthy. No medical conditions. Hasn't been how to reason to see a doctor before? No. Okay. And then just, uh, how was your pregnancy with him? Was it normal? Any complications? Uh, yeah. So, I had, uh, gestational diabetes, but it was treated, it was treated with diet. And blood sugars have been fine now. But no complications to the pregnancy from that regard as far as I know. Okay. Any alcohol or recreational drugs used during the pregnancy? No, nothing like that. No smoking either. Okay. Okay. Good. Um, and how, uh, far along were you when, when you, uh, delivered him? It was a vaginal delivery just after 38 weeks. Okay. So, he was full term. Um, and you said vaginal delivery. Did they have to induce you at all? Uh, no. Okay. And was he a normal birth weight? Yeah. He was. Yeah. I think he was, um, like just over three kilograms. Okay. Good. And was he healthy after birth? Did he have any breathing issues? Uh, John does anything like that? Uh, no breathing issues or, or, or John does. Um, came home with us, uh, right away. Okay. Okay. And then, um, after that point now, um, has he been normal in terms of this, uh, weight, height, head circumference? Yeah. Yeah. He's been growing normally and, um, eating well, um, up to this point. Okay. And I should ask, um, has he been hitting all his milestones? Like is he doing the things that his peers are doing? Yeah. I would say he's keeping up with his, his peers in daycare and, uh, no, no concerns with his development. Okay. Good. Is he on any medications? No medications. No. Okay. And is he up to date with all his immunizations? He is. Yes. Okay. And, um, any allergies? Um, got that we're aware of. Okay. Any family history of lung conditions? Um, no, no family industry, prevent any lung conditions. Okay. And, uh, so who does, who does he love with at home? So, um, you know, my, uh, myself, um, and, uh, his father and then sister. So there's just the four of us at home. Okay. And, uh, what's the relationship like between all of you? Is there any, uh, domestic issues, um, or, are things okay? Oh, things are, are great at home. Okay. Is there at least supportive environment? Okay. Good. And does anyone smoke at home? No one smokes at home. No. Okay. Um, any carpets at home? Old carpets? I think there's a few area rugs around, but most of the carpets are gone. Okay. Okay. All right. So it sounds like from what you're telling me, he... Oh, sorry, I should have asked you this earlier. Has he had any issues breathing? No problem. No problem breathing, but his voice does sound a bit... a little bit off, a bit husky. A bit husky? Okay. All right. And nothing like a seizure, like a febrile seizure, right? No. I haven't seen any like limb jerking or anything like that. Okay. So just roughly doing... from the sounds of it, it sounds like he has a serthroat that's been persistent. And we do this thing called a centorscore. So it sounds like he's had a fever, no cough, sore throat. So the first thing that we'd want to check to see or to rule out would be a strep throat. And then, well, if that comes back negative, we'll go from there and think about other viral causes for a strep throat as well. Did you have any questions or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today? No, we were thinking that it could be maybe strep throat. So yeah, thank you. Okay, great.

{"text": "That will bring you to clinic today. Hi, so I feel like I might have a bladder infection. I see a urologist because I've had some issues with like an overactive bladder for a while. I've had to see bladder infections in the past and this is usually how they feel. You guys feel like a little bit of burning when I go to the bathroom and I have to go like a lot right now. But then also sometimes it means that like it gets like this when I have my period and I don't have my period right now, but I, you know, I could be getting it, but I also just don't want to let it go. Keep going if I do have an infection. I just like, how they get it treated if I do. Okay, understood. When was your last period? Like two weeks ago? About two weeks ago. Are you fairly regular? Like yes and no. I'm not super irregular, but I sometimes have like basically it's like I alternate sometimes I, my cycle's like four weeks and sometimes it's more like five. Sorry, let's clarify. I get your third year's old. Yeah, I'm 30. Okay, are you only your contraception right now? No, I'm not. Okay, are you sexually active at all? No. No. Okay. So just in terms of your, you're in a retractive sections, what was your last one? I had one like three months ago, maybe three months ago. Okay. And they prescribed you antibiotics and it went away really quickly. Yeah, yeah, I went away. Like I always, I always have a no-vractive bladder and I always have to go pretty frequently like every hour sometimes half hour, but that's still there. But it's like it hasn't, it's been I haven't had any like pain. Okay, so you still have quite a, you have a, quite a bit of urgency to go. Kind of keep going more frequently, but I suppose the new thing they are a little bit concerned about is that it burns a little bit, stays a little bit when you do your knee. Am I understanding correctly? Exactly. Like for the past couple of days, it's about like that. Okay. Has it been getting progressively worse at all? Maybe a little bit. I feel like now I can recognize it pretty early when it's not too bad to kind of get ahead of it. Okay, understood. And do you have any pain kind of behind your ribs at all? When you're back. So I can repeat that. You haven't had any pain on your back, middle back kind of close to your ribs, have you? Not that I can think of. Okay. And have you noticed any changes to the quality of the year? For example, is it frothy or smelled bad? It maybe looks like a little cloudy. Nothing else out of the ordinary. Like I've never had blood in it or anything. Understood. Have you noticed any visual changes in the area here for Jaina? No, not that I can't see anything like that. Anything concerned for an STI that you're worried about? No. And like I haven't had a sexual partner in a few years. I'm understood. Understood. Is it kind of questions that we ask when someone's having a little bit of maybe an issue holding in their ear? But you are felt any numbness or inability to feel kind of around your buttocks region. For example, when you wipe with tissue paper, can you feel that well? Oh, yeah, I can feel everything. Okay. And no changes to your poops, to your balance. No. Well, it's pretty normal. Okay. And how do you feel otherwise? I mean, I feel a little tired. I felt like a little hot yesterday. I don't have a thermometer. I didn't take my temperature. But sometimes I feel a little hot like when I've had the infections before. Okay. You don't have me swelling on your body or your ankles, do you? No. I'm not. Anywhere on your body or your ankles, do you? No. No. Okay. And then so no puffiness around your eyes that you've noticed? No. I can't believe that. Any rashes or any changes on your face? Like my mom said, I saw my mom earlier and she said I looked like a little flushed. But it's not like a rash or anything. No. No markings across the bridge of your nose and your cheeks. No. Okay. And then in regards otherwise you feel a little flushed or tired. Any other medical issues that you have? No, just this like overactive bladder thing. Okay. And have they given you any medications for it? We tried a few different ones before. And now I get I get Botox injections into the bladder like maybe twice a year. Anything else they've used recently? Like any medications you're on right now, I suppose? No, nothing. No, nothing else. I guess I have like I have an inhaler, but I don't use it all the time. Like I haven't had it here in a while. So you have asthma? Yeah, like I honestly don't feel like I have it very much now, but I still have like I still have. Understood, understood. Anything else you've taken medications for in the past? Oh, I used to take birth control like the pill, but like I just I don't have the right now. And then it didn't really feel like I needed it otherwise. Understood, understood. And have you had any past surgeries? Um, I had my handiczo when I was 24. And that's it though. Okay, got it. And then just in terms of you yourself, do you live in London? Yeah, yeah, I do. Okay. Oh, what do you do for work? I work at a bank. Do you have any children? No. Okay. And in regards to anything, so any sick contacts? Uh, no. Any recent travel? No. Any allergies? Uh, like sometimes in this ring, I'll get like a little stuffy. Okay, so it's good. I feel like a lot of things are going to be like, yeah. Nothing too concerned. No drug allergies. No, nothing like that. I got it. Okay, I think what now doing next, I'll move to a physical exam. I think we might just do some investigations just in order to get some more information. And then the physician will come into see you. Okay.

{"text": "how may I help you? Hi, I'm Yasup. How does pain in my left elbow for a couple of weeks now? And it's not getting any better. So I'm just here to kind of figure out what it is. Okay.

Does the pain radiate anywhere? No, it's pretty, it's pretty much in that one area. Okay. Just on the medial side of the left elbow. Yeah. Okay. And is there anything that you've done to help make the pain go away or any alleviating factors? I've taken some NSAIDs and that helps with the pain temporarily. Okay. And are there any factors that make the pain worse? When I, I guess when I like extend my elbow out, it gets worse. Okay. So with some movement, okay, in straightening the elbow. Yeah. Okay. And what is the severity of the pain on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt? I said about five. Okay.

So do you take any medications either prescribed or over the counter? No. I just take some multivitamins. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications? No. No. Okay.

We live in an apartment together. Okay. And are you working currently? I am. And what do you do? I work on the assembly line for Chrysler. Okay. And do you do repetitive tasks at work? I do. Okay. And do you notice this pain after more so after a shift or after, after a long day? Yes. Definitely. Okay. And what types of hobbies do you have? Like do you play golf or tennis or any kind of like sports, I guess? Yeah. I used to play golf before this pain in my arm and my elbow. So I haven't played it in the past six months. Okay. Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes? I don't. And do you drink alcohol? I'll have a glass of wine every other day. Okay. How about the use of any recreational drugs like cannabis or anything else? I'll smoke a joint once a week. Okay. Okay. And is there any family history of any hard or lung problems? No. Any musculoskeletal or neurological diseases? I know. Okay. I would any autoimmune diseases like thyroid disease or diabetes? No. Okay. And so actually I just wanted to walk through a physical exam. So when you look at the elbow yourself, do you see any swelling or redness? No. Okay. Does it look like there is any muscle atrophy, either in the forearm or the biceps or triceps? No. Okay. And how about any misalignment or joint deformity? No, I don't see any of that. Okay. And are there any scars? No. Okay. And when you press on the medial part of the elbow, do you feel pain? I do. How about over the electron or the, yeah, any pain over the electron on? A little bit. Okay. And is there any pain over the lateral part of the elbow? No. Okay. And any pain over the forearm or biceps or triceps musculoskeletal? No. Okay. And does the joint feel like it's hot? No. Okay. And any pain with shoulder or elbow movements? No. Actually, sorry, with the elbow, when I straighten it out all the way, it hurts a little bit. Okay. When you straighten it out all the way. Okay. But no pain with shoulder movements and full range of motion? No. No pain with shoulder. Okay. And how about pain with pronation and supination? With pronation, it hurts. Okay. I have the medial side. Yes. Okay. And how about with wrist? So with resisted. Yeah, wrist flexion. wrist flexion? Yeah, that hurts too. Okay. And then how about if you passively extend your your wrist as far down as as you can go? Down. Yes, that hurts too. Okay. And is there any numbness or tingling anywhere? No, no, no, no, no, numbness or tingling. Okay. Okay. So that was everything that I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention? No, that was it. What do you think I have and how can I fix it? Yeah, so it certainly it sounds like with the media aspect of your elbow having pain there last several months. And so the physical exam maneuverer such as like passive wrist extension, resisted wrist flexion as well as pronation and the point tenderness over the medial elbow. Here's could be a medial epicon delitis or a tendon opathy in that area. And so this is typically treated with activity modification. So this could be trying to avoid repetitive movements that cause pain and using medications such as anvil and Tylenol and doing strengthening and stretching exercises, which you can learn from physiotherapists or on your own as well. And also other things that the medial side of the elbow that it could be is an ulnar ligament injury or yeah, or the other thing we're considering is an ulnar ligament injury. And so if the pain isn't going away, then we might consider an ultrasound or something to look at the structures there. Okay, that sounds great.

{"text": "And it sounds like you're experiencing some testing. Yeah, so this chest pain has just been coming on for the last couple of weeks now. Okay. So two weeks. And can you tell me kind of where you're feeling that pain? Yeah, I'm just feeling this chest is comfort sort of over on the left side. Left side. Okay. Does this stay just in one spot or does it kind of spread anywhere else? No, I don't really feel it anywhere else. Yeah, I just feel it in that one spot on the left side. Okay. Does it feel dull and achy or does it feel more sharp? It feels pretty sharp. And is it constant like on all the time or do you feel like it kind of comes and goes? It comes and goes. I would say it might last for 20, 30 minutes at a time and then it goes away. Okay. And over the last two weeks since you said it started, has it gotten any worst? No, it's been about the same. Okay. And has it gotten more frequent? It's like 20 to 30 minute episodes. No, it happens about two or three times. I have two weeks. And if you were to rate it on a scale of zero to ten, zero being no pain and 10 being like the worst thing you've ever felt, where would it fall? I would say a four to ten. If you think of anything that you've done differently recently that could have brought it on, or is there any kind of common factor between the times that you've had to pay? I don't know. I separated from my husband two years ago, which has been really stressful, but other than that, I mean, I can't really think of any changes to my health or anything like that recently. Okay. You feel like you have been more stressed out in general? Yeah. The last couple of years has been a lot more stressful because of the those issues in my personal life. I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad that you're coming in and we can hopefully get to the bottom of this. Not that I think that's necessarily the source of your pain. You definitely want to look into everything, but it has really helped open to know that. When you've had these episodes, have you taken anything to help with the pain or done anything that you felt has made it go away? I've tried some Advil, some Tylenol, and actually, some Tums as well, and it hasn't really helped. Do you think it's worse when you're moving around? If you're kind of doing more exercise or is it kind of just the same, not or what you're doing when you get to episode? It actually, I feel like it happens most of the time when I'm either at work or driving. Okay, and before this two-week period, have you ever had anything like this before? No, I haven't had anything like this happen before. Do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for? No, previously healthy. And just jumping back to these pain episodes, when you have them, do you experience anything else? Do you get any knowledge that are evolving? No. Do you have any difficulty breathing during these times? No, I haven't. Have you noticed any fevers? No fevers. Have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick recently? No, I haven't. And have you traveled anywhere? No, I've been home. Okay, so you have previously been healthy, nothing that you've been seeing your family doctor for on a regular basis. Do you take any medication? I do not. No medications. Just the Tylenol and Avril I tried for the pain. Do you have any allergies? No allergies. And is there any history of heart problems in your family? Yeah, my father had a heart attack when he was 60 just last year. And it's actually one of the reasons what concerns me about the chest pain that I was having. For sure, it always feels very concerning when you have these symptoms and you know people in your life that have had issues similar issues in the past. I don't know that this is related to that. I personally don't think so at this point, but we're definitely going to do everything to look into it and rule out something that would be scary like that. I'm going to ask you a few more questions about your life style in general. You smoked cigarettes? Yeah, I smoked about half a pack to a pack per day. I've been trying to quit and I was smoking one pack per day, but so it is down a little bit, but still something I'm trying to work on. Congratulations. That's really tough thing to do. Good for you. That's really exciting. Step in the right direction, right? Do you drink alcohol? I do, but I'll have maybe water or two glasses of wine on the weekends. Do you use any other symptoms? No. I know that you said you don't see your family doctor for anything regularly, but I just want to check a couple of specifics. Have you ever been told you have high blood pressure? No, I've never been told I've had high blood pressure. Have you ever been told you have high cholesterol? I haven't, but I've actually never been tested either. Do you exercise regularly? Yeah, I actually either do some running or cycling probably three or four days per week. I haven't had any chest pain or problems exercising. That's good to hear. Have you ever had problems with heartburn? I don't think so. No. Okay. So just to kind of summarize what we talked about. Over the last two weeks, you started having these 20 to 30 minute episodes of chest pain on the left side. It feels more sharp. Is that correct? Yeah. And it's kind of constant when it comes on. There's nothing really that makes it better or worse. It just kind of blows away on its own after half an hour. So it's kind of stayed the same over over the last two weeks. Haven't really gotten worse or better. It hasn't gone away either. Right. Yeah. And you have been, it sounds like experiencing some stress in your life that definitely can play into that as well. Okay. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about that I didn't ask you today? No, I think that's. Yeah, I think that's all that I wanted to talk about today. So what I'm going to do is bring all this information to your family doctor and we can come back together and talk to you about the next step. Awesome. Thank you.

And have you already received any sort of imaging or pulmonary function test or anything like that for this recently? Uh, no, I, I, I haven't. Okay. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any past medical history of any conditions really? Um, no, like I've been, um, previously healthy. Um, but I, I guess I did have a hysterectomy a few weeks ago. I know it was, I didn't bring it up before because it's just a day procedure, but, um, I was definitely spending a lot more time, um, relaxing at home after that, um, a few weeks ago. Okay. Okay. So you haven't been moving around as much, I guess, since the hysterectomy. Yeah, exactly. It's starting to, it was starting to get, the pain was starting to improve, but, um, it was keeping me, uh, on the couch a lot of days. Okay. Yeah. Um, are you on any medications?

Any family history of lung conditions? Uh, no lung conditions. Okay. How about heart? Yeah. It was my, my mom had a heart attack when she was, um, 56. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry to give that. Um, and any, uh, history of family history of something called pulmonary embolism or, uh, DVTs? Uh, no, I haven't heard of, uh, heard of pulmonary embolism before. Okay. So it's basically, um, blood clots in your lung. And then DVTs are deep vein thrombosis. So also blood clots, but in different parts of your body. Okay. Yeah. Anything like that that you know of? Uh, I have, I might have heard of something like that, um, happening in my mom, actually, I might have been related to her, uh, heart attack, but I'm not specifically sure. Okay. Sure. Um, and then do you smoke? Um, I, I spoke, uh, maybe about half a pack of cigarettes per day. I've, I've spoken, um, ever since I was a teenager, I've tried to quit, uh, multiple times. I, I was smoking about a pack per day before. So I have cut it down, but, uh, still something that I'm working on. Okay. Good. I'm glad you're trying to cut down. Um, we have resources available if you're interested in somewhat help. Um, and do you smoke, um, marijuana? Uh, no, I don't. Okay. Any, uh, use of other recreational drugs? Uh, no. No. Okay. And how about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol? Uh, maybe a glass of wine on the weekends, but, um, other than that, no. Okay. Um, and have you had any sick contacts recently? People around you. People you live with that work. I can't think of anybody who's been sick. No. Okay. Okay. And, and what do you do for work, Jen? Um, I work as an administrator at, uh, at a bank. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, and have you traveled anywhere recently? Uh, no, I, I can't remember the last vacation. Okay. All right. Um, so, those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have anything that you wanted to add anything that I hadn't touched on? Um, no, I think you covered, uh, everything. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. No worries. So I guess at this point, we would do a physical exam, just take a listen to your lungs and your chest, um, after that. So right now, uh, it sounds like it could be something vascular, you know, like a pulmonary embolism like we talked about. That's kind of high on my list of, uh, things to work up for. Um, but also we don't want to miss other things, uh, you know, like cancer, infection, um, autoimmune things that could affect your lungs. So we'll just do a work up for all of that. Um, how does that sound? Yeah, whatever, whatever you think, uh, we need to do. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you for your time. Yeah.

{"text": "Would you mind by starting with what brought you in today? Yeah, so I'm just coming in with my son. He's six years old and yeah, just over the last few days, he's not been himself and he's been having this stomach ache. So which started around like, I would say three days ago. And then he's also having a vomiting for the last two days. He's vomited in total six times over the last two days. And then yesterday, he also developed a fever as well. And I managed to measure it and it was 38.3 degrees Celsius. Okay, I see. So just so that I'm understanding the timeline. So he started to have abdominal pain about three days ago. I started with having vomiting and diarrhea two days ago. And you checked his temperatures at a fever as of yesterday. Yeah. Okay.

And has the what was the vomiting triggered by anything that you're aware of? Like eating or drinking? Yeah. Two days ago it was after lunch, when he first vomited. But after that, it's just kind of random. I see. Okay. And in regards to his diarrhea, has there been any any blood or any color changes? No, no, I didn't notice any blood at all. It's definitely just very watery. And he's had to go probably even just in the last day, probably around like six or seven times. Okay. And he's vomited how many times? So in total, I can count six times. Okay. And has he been complaining about any headaches? So no, not that I know. Okay. And how about any ear pain or eye pain? No, not that he's mentioned to me.

No. Okay. And has he had any pain anywhere in any chest pain? No, he did point to his stomach like it seems like he was having with all the vomiting like he was having some stomach pain as well. Okay. Is there any specific location that that he's feeling the pain? It's hard to say. He was just pointing at the center of his belly. Like I don't know if it's like I tried pressing on it and feeling pain then I think it's just kind of all over his stomach. Okay. And as he had any urinary problems like painful, boyding or being more often. No, he's been okay. Have you noticed any rashes or skin changes? No, not really. Okay. And has he had any muscle aches or joint pains that he's mentioned? No, he hasn't mentioned anything like that. Okay. And he's had a fever as he had chills. Yeah.

So yeah, definitely he was having chills. Okay. And and and have there been any concerns with his growth and other weight or height? So he's been playing all of the charts pretty well. Like your concerns during his growth. Otherwise he's a very healthy child. Okay. So no medical diagnoses previously. No, nothing like that. Okay. And and is he meeting all developmental milestones? Okay. It got a gross motor, fine motor. I'm doing well at school. Yeah. I mean, he's, yeah, and then didn't have any issues with walking, running. It's pretty social with all his peers. He's doing well at school. No complaints. Okay. Excellent. And to no medical conditions, but has there been any reasons for being in the hospital before? No, not at all. We, yeah, we haven't really gone to the doctor with him after like all those vaccinations I get to do. So he's been good. Okay. Great. So I'm immunizations are up to date. Yeah, immunizations all up to date. Excellent. And does he have any allergies? And no, not anything that we know of yet. Okay. And just wanted to ask about his birth history. Were there any complications throughout pregnancy, either mom being safe or having any, any issues herself? And also it was a normal, vaginal delivery. No issues. He was born at 39 weeks. Didn't need to stay in the hospital at all. Yeah, it was a pretty smooth pregnancy compared to some of the other ones. Okay. No, that's, that's great. Do you remember that appgar score or his birth weight? I don't exactly remember his appgar scores. I think they were like just, just, they were normal. Like there was nothing concerning about that. And birth weight, I think he was probably around three, three kilograms. Okay, great. So, and yeah, healthy birth weight at term, it sounds like. And so healthy, does he take any medications regularly? No, no medications. Okay. And can you tell me about who he's living with currently and who's looking after him? Yeah, so he's living with myself, his mother and, and my husband. And he has two older siblings. One is a boy, seven years old and another one, like a 10 year old girl. Okay. And has anybody in the house been sick? No, no one has been sick recently. However, he does, they did let them go back into school at one point. So I don't know, I don't know. So that was his last week. So I don't know if he caught something from school. Okay, but nobody that you know that's had similar symptoms. No, no, okay. And maybe travel anywhere. No, we've been, we've been at home. Okay. And then, yeah, no recent changes to anything in the diet you've mentioned. No, that's the plan. Okay. And any concerns for safety in the home, whether the physical or, or verbal abuse? No, no concerns like that. Okay. Yeah, a question that we have to ask everybody. And is there any smoking in the home? No, no, we don't smoke. Okay. Great. And are there any pets? No, no pets. All right. And in the family, has there been anybody who's had any heart problems or any lung problems? We are getting the ten year old tested for just asthma. Okay. But nothing diagnosed yet. Okay. Anybody in the family have any congenital diseases or any genetic diseases? No, not that I know. Hello. Okay. Anybody in the family have a silly act disease or, or Crohn's disease? No, no, no history of any kind of novel diseases. Okay. So I think that's everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything that maybe I forgot to ask or, or that I missed it? What do you want to tell me? Yeah, no, it's also just like I was just reading up. Can it be like, I don't know if it can be COVID as well, if it can, you can do this as well. It is possible. It's especially with non-specific symptoms, COVID can cause a variety of different presentations and there for some people it can be more gastrointestinal issues like your son has with vomiting and diarrhea and belly pain, but it also could be another type of gastrointestinal virus itself or a viral illness like the common cold, which can also end up causing symptoms like this as well. So we will go ahead and do a COVID test today along with some other but work and maybe increase the hydration as well. How it sounds like he has lost a lot of fluid over these last couple of days. So we'll check electrolytes and go from there on the test results. All right, sounds good.

{"text": "way help you. Hi Chris. So I was playing soccer the other day and I got kicked in the knee and since then my knee has been hurting and it looks a little bit red and a little bit swollen on the medial aspect of my right knee. Okay and and this started right after the kick at soccer. Yes. Okay and how many days ago was this? This was two days ago. Okay since then as the pain didn't getting any better or worse or staying the same. No it's staying the same or a little bit worse. Okay. Could you describe the pain? Is it sharp, achy? Yeah it's pretty sharp. Okay and do you feel the pain radiates anywhere like down the leg or up into the thigh? I know. Okay. Any pain that the posterior aspect of the knee or the lateral aspect? No. Okay. And is there anything that makes the pain worse? I guess if I press on that area or I try to let it out flex or extend my knee too much. Okay and anything that you've tried to make the pain better? Some ice helps. Okay. And have you noticed swelling over the area? Just a little bit. Okay and redness as well? Yes. Okay and what would you say the severity of the pain is attempting the worst pain that you've ever felt and one being low intensity pain? I give it about a five. Okay and if you had any injuries or any knee pain before? No. Okay and at the time of the injury, did you hear a pop sound or any kinds of sounds like that? I don't recall. Okay and how about any difficulties walking or having any knee instability? A little bit. Only when I like try to extend or flex my knee too much. Okay. And all right so have you been experiencing any other symptoms? No. All right. Just to be comprehensive I'll run through a review. So have you been having any headaches? No. Any sensory changes like changes to vision, hearing, spell or taste? No. Okay. Any eye symptoms or ear symptoms? No. Have you had a runny nose or sore throat? No. We had a cough? No. Any shortness of breath? No. Have you had any wheezing? No. Have you had any chest pain? No. Any heart palpitations or heart racing? No. Okay. Have you had any fainting or dizziness?

Have you had any skin changes such as brat rashes or anything like that? No. Okay. Any joint pains anywhere else? No. Okay. And any fatigue? No. Okay. All right. And in the past, have you had or have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions? I know. Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications? No. No. Nothing. I know of. Are you currently taking any medications? No. All right. And have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations before? No. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about your living situation, like who you're living with and whereabouts? Sure. I live with with my parents and three of my siblings. Okay. I am. Are you going to school? I am. I'm in my last year of grade 12. Okay. That's good. How has happened going? It's been going okay. We've been doing part online part in person. Okay. Have you been around anybody who's been sick? No. All right. And you play soccer. Do you play any other sports? And I play football. Okay. Cool. And any injuries before to your knee or anything like that? I know. I'm in the past. All right. And do you smoke cigarettes? No. Do you drink alcohol? No. Okay. And you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or anything else? No. Okay. Are you currently sexually active? I am. Okay. Are you in a relationship? I am. I have been together for a year. Okay. Is there any concern for sexually transmitted infection? No. We were both tested. Okay. Great. And any chance that you could be pregnant? No. Okay. Okay. And in the family, are there any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions? No. Okay. And so that was everything I wanted to ask on history. So for the physical exam, when I'm inspecting the knee, are you seeing any joint effusions or joint swelling or echinosis or bruising? Um, it looks, it's not a bruise. It looks red. And I would say it's a little bit swollen on the video aspect, Ome. Okay. Is there any muscle atrophy? No. Okay. And is there any misalignment or joint deformities? No. Not that I notice. Okay. And on gait or walking, is there any limb for antelgy? No. If you're able to walk normally? I am able to walk normally. It hurts, but I think I'm walking okay. Okay. And next is there any changes to temperature? Like does that joint itself feel hot? No. Okay. And are there any areas of the joint line itself of the knee that is paying to the palpation? Just the medial part of it like the, I guess where the ligament would be? Okay. So just let me, okay. Any pain over the patella? No. Any pain over the tubular tuberosity or patella tendon? No. Any pain over the fibular head or the lateral part of the knee? No. Any pain on the calf or the thigh muscles? No. Any pain on the hamstring muscles? No. Okay. And is there any pain to a, like, various stress of the knee? To the various stress. I guess there will be pain if I press down in that area. Okay. And is there any joint, you know, joint laxity or pain to like a valgus stress of the knee? Yeah. So when I press, when I do that, it hurts on the medial aspect but not the lateral aspect. Okay. And does it feel as though there's some, like, the joints opening more when you put the valgus stress? A little bit, yes. Okay. And is there any instability moving that tibia anteriorly if you're like, pull it outwards? No. And how about if you pull the tibia posteriorly, any instability? No. Okay. And is there full range of motion of the knee? Yes. And full range of motion of the hip and ankle? Yes. Okay. And then do you have any, like, numbness, tingling or muscle weakness? No. Okay. And any sensory changes to the skin? No. Okay. And reflexes aren't normal. Okay. So I think that was everything I wanted to ask and kind of go through on the physical exam. Did you have any other questions or anything that maybe I forgot to mention today? No, that was it. Just what can I do about my knee? Yeah. So right now it's sounding like this could be an MCL or a medial collateral ligament strain or injury. And so these types of injuries are usually treated conservatively, like with things like NSAIDS or anti-inflammatories to help the pain and swelling. If the pain, depending on how severe it is, it might be useful to use maybe crutches for a day or two to try to help let the pain subside and allow you to be able to do some physical therapy exercises, like strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. But typically injuries that are lower grade will heal within two weeks. And so if it's more severe, it could take a bit longer. And although it's most likely MCL injury that you're describing, it could be a medial meniscal injury as well, or possibly even a percitis at the medial aspect of the knee. But the treatment to start with would be the same and maybe we'll get a knee x-ray if things aren't improving. Okay, that sounds good.
