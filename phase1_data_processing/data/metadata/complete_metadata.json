    "transcription": "What's you in? I've had this pain on the outside of my right elbow now. I first started noticing it several months ago, but recently it's just been more painful. Okay. So you said several months ago. Did anything happen several months ago? Was there any sort of trigger, trauma, anything like that to that area? No, there wasn't any trauma or any triggers that I noticed. I was just feeling it a bit more at the end of work. Yeah, I was just having a feeling of pain a bit more at the end of work. Okay. Does anything make it better or worse, the pain? Yeah, if I really if I'm just resting the elbow, it makes it better. And I've tried things like ibuprofen, which has helped with the pain. I'll do that for helping get through work sometimes if the pain's bad enough. Okay. And if you were to describe the quality of the pain, is it sharp, rocky, achy? It's kind of, well, it's achy and then sometimes depending on the movement, it can get, it can be sharp as well. Okay. Okay. And what sorts of movements make it worse? So like really it's mostly movements at my wrist. If I'm bending my wrist down, I can, I can feel it or if I'm having to pick things up or hold heavy objects at work, I do a lot of repetitive things that I can't do. Things that at work at work online. Okay. Okay. And once it's 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt, how bad is this pain? It is about a four. About a four. Okay. And have you ever experienced this type of pain before? No, I haven't. No, okay. And do you feel like your pain's getting worse over the past several months or is it the same getting better? It's been getting worse. It's been getting worse. Okay. Okay. Have you tried any like topical ointments or anything like that for it? I did. Yeah, I tried some stuff that you can get at the drug store and it did help take the edge off a little bit. Okay. All right. And are you still able to move that arm, your right arm as well as your hand? I am. Yeah. I have full range of motion of both the elbow and hand. Okay. And it's not like preventing you from doing everyday tasks. No, I've been able to manage so far at work, but it is starting to become an issue with my job. All right. And then do you have any sorts of aches or pains in any other joint or muscle groups? No, it's just right there on the outside of my right elbow. Okay. Really annoying because I'm right handed as well. So you guys causing problems there. Right. And is that pain radiating upwards or downwards? No, I kind of just feel it right over that that one spot. Okay. Any numbness or tingling in that arm? No, no numbness or tingling. Yeah. Okay. And then have a like your arm feeling like it's cold. No, I haven't had anything like that. All right. And then otherwise do you have any other symptoms? No, it's just been a little pain. Okay. So no weight loss. No, my weight's been stable over these last few months. Okay. Fever or chills? No, I haven't had any fevers or chills. Okay. Any fatigue? No, my energy's been good. Okay. Have about um, rashes. Uh, no rashes. Okay. Changes to your senses like vision hearing smell, smell or taste? No changes there. Okay. Any coughing, shortness of breath or weezing? No. Okay. Chest pain, any heart palpitations or uh, dizziness? Nothing like that. Okay. Changes to your bowel movements? No. No. No, no, not your vomiting? No, I haven't had any not your vomiting. Okay. Changes to your urine? No. I haven't had any urinary symptoms. Okay. And memory loss or confusion? No. Okay. So if you look at that right elbow, um, do you notice any redness or swelling? Uh, no, I don't. No. Okay. Does it seem misaligned or like asymmetrical compared to your other elbow? No, it looks, it looks the same. Looks the same. Okay. So no um, skin changes or deformities there? Uh, no. No. Okay. All right. And now I'm going to get you to um, just palpate um, that lateral, or yeah, the lateral aspect of that elbow. And you let me know if you feel pain when you push, push on that. I feel it's pain at the lateral, lateral elbow. How about the medial aspect? No pain. Okay. And have it when you palpate your forearm and your biceps. Uh, no pain. Okay. All right. And then do you feel like it's hot? That area? No. No. Okay. Now I am going to get you to um, extend your wrist. Okay. And then keep your elbow in full extension as well. Does that hurt? Uh, it does. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Have about when you flex your wrist with the elbow still in full extension. All right. It does. Yeah. That hurts as well. Okay. Have about when you flex your elbow. Uh, no, but that doesn't cause any pain. Have about when you extend your shoulder all the way up. No, nothing there. And then. Okay. And then flexing your, uh, sorry, adefting your shoulder. Not feels normal. All right. And then have about when you pronate and supinate your forearms. Uh, pronation. So like twist your arm inward so that your palm is facing the floor. No, that doesn't really cause any pain pronation and supination. Okay. All right. Um, all right. And then are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions? Um, I'm healthy. You're healthy. Okay. And then do you have, have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past? I had a surgery for a C section for my, my son, um, but that's, that's it. Okay. Okay. And, um, how long ago was that? That was about 17 years ago. Okay. And was that an emergency C section? Uh, no, it was not. Okay. Um, and then are you on any medications? Um, no, I've just been taking a Tylenol and an Anvil, um, for the pain. Okay. All right. Um, immunizations wise, are you up to date? I, I am. Yes. Okay. Do you have any allergies? Uh, no allergies. Okay. Family history of any, uh, skeletal or muscular, um, issues. Um, no, nothing like that in the family. Okay. Neurological issues in the family. Um, no neurological issues in the family. Okay. How about autoimmune conditions? Uh, no, nothing like that. Okay. And then, um, do you smoke? Uh, no, I haven't smoked before. Okay. Do you do marijuana? No, I don't use that. Um, alcohol. Um, uh, yeah, I'll have a glass of wine every once in a while, but maybe just one, one a week. And, uh, have you been around the context recently? Um, no, I haven't been around anybody who's been sick. Okay. Any recent travel? Uh, nope. I've been at home. Um, I think those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself? Uh, no. Well, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my, in my elbow. Yeah. So right now it seems like you may have a case of something called, um, lateral epicon delitis. So it's also known as, uh, tennis elbow. Um, and there are a lot of things I could kind of predispose you to this. Um, so it could be like the repetitive strain at work. Um, and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor, muscle group there. Um, so for this, we basically recommend, um, a couple of things to manage the pain. Uh, but first, uh, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures. Um, so to help you treat this, um, we recommend some activity modifications. So, um, at work, not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those extensor forum muscles. Um, and then you can use some, uh, use the compression sleeve as well. Continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain. And, uh, really important is physical therapy, um, to increase mobility and strength in that arm. Uh, and as well, you can apply things like ice, um, to it for, like the pain and swelling if you see any. Uh, yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most. Uh, but normally it does, um, go away in a couple months with some physical therapy and the, the compression and splints if you choose to do that. How does that sound? Yeah, that sounds, um, good. Thank you. Yeah, worries.",

    "transcription": "I understand that you've been having some diarrhea. Can you tell me a little bit about that? Yeah, sure. I've been having diarrhea for the past three to four days. And it's been pretty bad. I couldn't go to my classes. I had to skip because it was just embarrassing. OK, I'm sorry to hear that. Three to four. Have you had anything like this before? Have I ever experienced something like this before? Yeah, I don't think so. OK. And over the three to four days, have your stool all been loose or have you had some solid ones in between? I think it's mostly been loose. I think they've all been loose, actually. I think about it. OK, and how many times a day have you been having as a third of the day, area? Oh my god. I've lost count. I'm going every hour. Maybe. OK, I have hours. OK. And have you noticed any changes in the color of your stool? No, it's brown. OK. Any blood in your stool that you've noticed? I'm not really. I don't think so. I don't look that much, to be honest. OK. Have you noticed any pain associated with it? Well, I didn't start off with being, but I do have a bit of a cramp now since yesterday. It hurts sometimes. It comes and goes. OK. And do you feel that when it's, do you feel that you still have control over releasing it, do you like to sit come on? And then you don't even notice that it has happened, or you still are able to kind of have a warning before you get to the toilet. No, I do get a warning, but it's just, I do need to get to the toilet really fast. OK. Yeah. OK. And before this happens, have you noticed, have you, is there anything that you've done differently that you've been eating differently or any other changes that happened in your life recently? I did go to a new restaurant five days ago. OK. What have you had there? I just got some rice with chicken, chicken and durian. It was a nice little, any restaurant. And yeah. Did anyone else have the same thing that you did that you were with? I know, not really. I went with my friend and I haven't really, I haven't talked to her about this. I never really thought that these were related. That this was related to that. And it's, you know, absolutely, potentially not. Like it's maybe not. It could possibly be, so not to worry you about that. We just go like to get an idea of kind of the whole picture of what you're coming in this. So in terms of the last three to four days, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting? Yeah. Yeah. I have actually, but it's not been as bad as the diarrhea. I didn't even, yeah, I didn't even think about that. Yeah, I did vomit, I think, twice yesterday. OK. Have you noticed any blood in the vomit? No, it's just watery. OK. And are you nauseated all the time, or is it kind of on and off? It's on and off. OK. Have you taken any, any over-the-counter medicine or anything to help? Not really. I was trying to drink a lot of water, because I know that I can get dehydrated. So just drinking water. Yeah, that's all right. OK. So let's continue here. Have you been eating normally or have you not been eating as much as you regularly do? I have been eating less. Especially since yesterday when I had the best disease abdominal cramps started. I just don't feel like eating. OK. Is there anything that has been making it worse? Making what worse? In general, is there anything that you're finding makes your nausea or your diarrhea come on? Not really. I don't think so. Do you notice any changes to your urine or any discomfort when going to the bathroom? No. Have you traveled anywhere recently? No. OK. And have you noticed any fever or chills in the last few days? I've just been feeling really tired. And I don't know. Maybe I haven't checked my temperature. Have you noticed any rashes or changes in your skin? No. Do you notice any major changes to your weight? I know that you might not weigh yourself every day, but anything that jumps out to you? I actually haven't weighed myself in the past five days, so I don't know. OK. OK. OK. And I'm just going to jump to you in your general history. Do you have any history of problems with your digestive system? No. OK. Do you have any chronic conditions that you see if they're only doctor for regularly? I have asthma. OK. You take any medications? Yeah, I've got some buffers that my family dog gave me. OK. Nothing else? No, that's it. Do you have any medications? No, I don't. Have you supplied some of them? Sorry, can you see that again? Have you ever been hospitalized in the past? I haven't had wisdom teeth removed, but no, I wasn't hospitalized. No. Have you been in contact with anyone recently that's been sick? Nope. I don't think so. OK. Is that your living situation right now? You said you're a student? I am. OK. And do you live on your own, the family with roommates? I'll live with roommates. Do you drink alcohol? Sometimes. OK. How many drinks per week would you say? I might have a glass or two on the weekends. OK. Do you smoke? No. OK. Do you use any other substances? Nope. And what would you eat on a regular day? Typical. Your typical diet, please. Oh gosh. Well, I like to have oatmeal for breakfast. I usually make something quick for lunch, maybe like a salad. And then I might have, I'll probably just eat out at night, maybe get a burger or fries or something. OK. Cool. And I just wanted to jump over to ask you about your family history. Does anyone in your family have any history of digestive problems or abdominal problems, abdominal surgeries? My brother had a band of side-as. When he was young, my mom has had his direct to me. If that counts. If that counts? Yeah. Nothing else. OK. OK. Thank you for sharing that with me. So I think that's everything that I wanted to ask you for today.",

    "transcription": "Hey Doc, I'm a 45 year old man. I'm just coming in. I'm worried there's a little rash on my leg. I'm getting nervous about. Hi. So I understand you have a rash on your leg. I don't really know what I would call it. That's what I told the nurse when I came in, but it's more hurts than anything. Right. How long have you been going on for? It's been looking weird for about a week, but only yes. It started hurting yesterday. It's sort of looking strange. And I just wanted to come in to get it checked out. OK. When you say it's looking strange, can you tell me what you mean by that? Slow one. It looks bigger than it did before. Meanor, if that makes sense. Slow one. OK. Is it red? Yeah, it's red. It's turning more red, kind of in the area around it. I've got these scabs. I've got diabetes and dogs. I think the best with it. I haven't scratched in at it. And normally it's not that bad, but this is just strange looking. There's no other word for it. OK. Have you ever had anything like this before? I guess you've kind of just said that you didn't, but I was double checked. No, no. Well, I've had occasional ulcers and sometimes I've banged my toe, not exactly the best, taking care of my feet, but this is the first time I've gone something that I've just never seen it before. OK. Do you have any ulcers right now on your feet? I think so. When I last saw this little family dog, I think I've got an ulcer on my left heel, but I think it's doing all right. OK. And what leg are you having this problem with right now? So I'm right. So my ankle. OK. How have your sugar been controlled, breaking me? I just thought measuring them. Yeah, last time I measured it was pretty bad. I think I A1C last time was like nine and something. I'm trying better to be with it. This is hard with work, you know? For sure, I can imagine. So in general, even if you don't know your number for your sugar, have you felt worse than usual lately? Have you felt run down at all? Yeah, actually I have. Being more and feel hungry sometimes is tired, but how? No, it's hard to tell. There's an off-lock going on in my life right now with the kids, but it's hard to tell. I think, yeah, I need to see my family dog. OK. Definitely, you know, a good idea moving forward just to make sure you get on top of these things. But I'm glad you came in today. So we can, you know, have a better look at you and make sure that there's nothing super concerning going on. So in addition to this, have you had any other new symptoms? Symptoms, I feel a little hot actually. When the swelling started, it also started leaking this like white stuff from one of the, what used to be a scab. So now, like kind of open room now. OK. OK. So when did you start feeling hot? Honestly, last 12 hours. OK. Can you take your temperature at all? No. I don't have a thermometer at home. Have you had any difficulty breathing? No. No. Any testing? Nope. Have you noticed that your left, sorry, your right leg feels any hotter than the left? Yeah. Yeah, it does actually. Changing socks the other day. Yeah. Hey, have you like, have you felt ill recently? Have you been sick at all? Hmm. Aside from just feeling a little crummy last couple of weeks, no. Don't really less energy today. But I was up last night thinking about this. Yeah. Wanted to come in and talk. Yeah, I'm, you do the right thing. I'm glad that you're in today. Is the pain on your leg worse when you catch it? Yeah. Maybe not so much when I touch it. When I walk with it and I start flexing it, it doesn't like that. OK. OK. Just resting it right now. It feels fine. It's OK. OK. OK. Well, I'm going to, if I think of any more questions specifically about your leg, I will go back to it. But I'm going to move on. And ask you two questions about your overall health. You've already shared with me that you are diabetic. Do you have any other chronic conditions that you live with? On condition. See the family talk about cholesterol. If you want to pill for that. Had asthma as a kid. I'll talk about your initial know. And my back, I've had back pain for the last 10 years. But I don't know what it really takes for its Tylenol at build for that. Oh, my other question about your leg is, have you lost any feeling in it? No. It kind of like a doll egg sometimes when I touch it. But no, like in the area, the ankle, no. But definitely on my feet, like over the years, I've noticed. I feel less on it, and heard what I did previously. Yeah. OK. That makes sense. OK. So I talked to her. So we talked about diabetes. You said you have my cholesterol. So what medications are you currently taking? I'm taking four pills right now. One of them is for the cholesterol. I think it's called Rasuvistatin. The other three, they're all diabetes medications. But I don't remember. That form is one of them. Sit a slum. I have a list somewhere. I'll get that to you later. OK. Are you on insulin right now? No. Are you on any of these medications new? Do you have a reason? No. No. I've had to provide a year now. Do you have any allergies? Yeah, I do, actually. Kind of selling. Can't take that. And what happens when you take Ted as a villain? It's been a while as a kid. Apparently, like, face got loaded. It was just have a hard time breathing. So OK. Well, we'll make sure that we don't give you that. Can you tell me if you've had any previous surgery? Yeah. What was it? I had my sinuses. I had some pretty bad sinusitis when I was in my teens. And they went in kind of carved a little bit of space out. OK. OK. Is that the only surgery that you've had? Yeah. But. And can you tell me do you have any family history of diabetes, in problem, anything else that stands out to you? Yeah. I'm side of the family. Anyone who has diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol. That side of the family is pretty healthy. I think maybe one of my aunts had lung cancer, which is a pretty big smoke, too. And I'm hoping I'll do a few questions about your lifestyle. So you said that you have children? Yeah, I do. Do you live in town? Do you live with your kids? I live in town. I see my kids over two weeks. And what do you do for work that I already asked you this? No, I'm currently unemployed. I'm looking for work. Partially employed, I suppose. You should say, I work in my own business. I see. And what do you do when you are working ideally? When I have working, I'm going to count. OK. Cool. And you smoke? Yeah, once in a while. Yeah. I'm stressed, though. I think I've got an average. Last couple of weeks, I've been smoking more. Maybe like two packs a week. OK. Do you drink alcohol? Yeah. Yeah. How much do you typically drink? Average week. Maybe a two, four. So maybe like three per day or something like that? A few were to average it out? Yeah, if you average it out, I may only go through the two, four a weekend to be honest. Oh, I see. OK. More so on the weekend. So maybe a little bit more than three per day back in on those days. OK. Oh, I think that that's everything that's out. I need to ask you for now. I'd like to get a closer look at this leg. Did you have any other questions or concerns before we move forward with the floor of your pants? No, I just want to get this figured out. Yeah, we'll definitely do that for you. So I'm going to have a look at it. And then I'll show that I will go talk to the doctor that I'm working with. And we'll see what we can do for you. Is that sound good? Thank you, doc. Yeah, sounds great. Awesome. OK. Thanks.",

    "transcription": "brings in here today. Hi there. I've just last night I was I went for a run and I twisted my ankle I think I stepped on something and it it really hurts. Okay and so when did you have the injury? It was just yesterday. Okay. Yeah it was just yesterday that it happened. Okay and do you remember if you twisted it so you twisted your ankle like did it twist inwards or outwards? Inwards yeah I feel like I inverted my ankle. Okay and so since then were you able to stand up and were you not able to bear any weight? No I was able to kind of finish the I just finished the walk I was able to walk home because it didn't hurt that bad immediately it was painful but the pain really started a few hours later and has been pretty much constant ever since. Okay okay so it kind of got worse over time over the last day. Yeah and do you notice any kind of bruising, redness, falling any skin changes? No I haven't really noticed really any swelling or or skin changes. Yeah no skin changes and no swelling. Okay and how would you describe the pain? Is it like a dull aching pain or sharp stabbing pain? Doll and achy. Okay yeah and has this happened to you and your ankle before? I feel like I've done something like this when I was younger or maybe playing basketball or something like this when I was a kid. Yeah I've twisted my ankle before. Okay and does this pain just stay in, where's the pain exactly on the right side of your ankle or on your left like interior side? It's on the right kind of outside of the ankle. And which ankle is this just to clarify? Oh sorry on the right ankle. Okay so it hurts on the right side of the right ankle. Yeah exactly. Okay and does the pain radiate or move anywhere in your feet? Oh it can kind of feel it around on the sole of my foot as well. We're mostly on that outside though. Okay and is there anything that makes the pain better or worse? It gets worse really if I move my ankle or if I'm standing on it. Okay and anything that makes it better? Just if I rest and avoid moving it. Okay have you noticed any fevers or chills? No. Okay any pain in any other joints besides your ankle? No just my right ankle. Okay any appetite or weight changes? No I've been just training for this race coming up so I mean I've been just trying to work on my fitness a little bit but my weight's been relatively stable. Okay any weakness in your right right extremities or any kind of numbness or tingling sensation? No numbness or tingling and no muscle weakness either. Okay All right have you diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past? Um I had diarrhea a few months ago and I was given a fluoroquine alone as an antibiotic. Okay so those two months ago? Mm-hmm. Okay um and any medications that you're on currently? Um I take um vitamin D and some other vitamins to um and vitamin A as well I guess to just help my my skin and um and then the vitamin D for my bones. Okay um any allergies, turning medications or any environmental issues? No allergies no. Okay any hospitalizations or previous surgeries? No. Okay um any family history of any musculoskeletal conditions, any rheumatological conditions, um anything that you know of? Um my grandparents have arthritis um and my uh like my dad had had had gallp before. Okay and do your grandparents have rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis? You know Uh I think osteo yeah osteoarthritis. Okay um and do you currently work? Uh I do yeah I work um as a software engineer. Okay um and what's your living situation like currently? Uh right now I'm actually just living alone uh in an apartment. Okay um and do you smoke it all? No. Never I can't with uh with all this like training for yeah uh the race and stuff like that. Okay that's good. Uh any recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, eatin' with that before? No I never use anything like that in the past. Okay and how about alcohol? Uh rarely I'll have maybe an asoon like once every couple of months but it's pretty infrequent. Okay um all right so I just have a few questions uh um so right now over your right ankle. Do you have uh so you mentioned you don't have any swelling but do you notice any kind of uh redness or warmth at all? No nothing like that. Okay if you press down in your ankle does it hurt a lot? I a little bit of pain on it right um uh like outside but it's not uh uh wait it doesn't hurt that bad. So no it's not. Yeah I'll say no. Okay um and if you kind of uh uh are you able to uh move your ankle at all? I can yeah I can move it around a little bit I'm trying to avoid that though just because it does hurt but I can move it around. Okay and are you able to stand up and walk or uh are you not able to do that right now? I can yeah just short periods of time because it's uh just the pain but I can walk on it. Okay um yeah so definitely what we'll do is we might need to get like a proper physical examination done um to make sure there's no fracture. Most likely though it seems that this may just be an ankle sprain and due to you inverting your ankle the other day. What we can do is uh usually we just uh immobilize the ankle and then recommend applying ice um you can take some uh and says like add bill for pain to help you um and it should um it should uh get better on its own with some physiotherapy later on as well. However um if we find that on physical examination you are having a significant pain on palpation or any kind of bony pain we might also require you to get an x-ray of the right foot and ankle um as well as just your lower leg. So yeah we'll have you come come in in person and then go from there and see if you need an x-ray. Okay that sounds good thank you. All right let's take care. Bye.",

    "transcription": "How may I help you? I just came in here today. I've been having a lot of shoulder pain that's just kind of left me not doing any of my activities recently. System or left shoulder. OK. And when did this pain start? It started five days ago. But it became pretty bad. And I've been kind of having like a somewhat of a pain for the last couple of weeks. But it got really bad just this week. OK. Did you have any trauma to this shoulder, like any injuries or triggers that could have caused the pain? I have been just going to the gym more frequently over the last few months, lifting weights, and things like that. But just this week I wasn't really able to do that either. OK. When you were lifting weights, like a few days ago, was there an episode where there was an acute onset of the pain? It got worse kind of right away. I think it was more progressive. But five days ago, I do feel that there was just I was having some pain before that. But then I just noticed all working. I started having more pain. But yeah, I don't think there was anything like sudden that happened though. OK. But yeah, I was progressing. And then it got acutely worse with the weight lifting. It sounds like. Maybe I did increase my weight in the last two weeks. So I did feel like a little bit more pain that increased last week. OK. I see. And in the left shoulder, do you feel the pain at the front that the sides or back? It hurts particularly in the front part of the shoulder. OK. Do you feel that it's radiating anywhere else? Just my whole left shoulder, nothing else really. OK. And could you describe the character or the quality of the pain? Is it sharp or is it achy? It's more achy. But certain, like some movements, it can get kind of sharp. OK. And has there been anything that has made the pain worse? If I just, if I carry anything with my left arm, or if I have to lift anything, or place it on my shoulder, like it really hurts. OK. And have you done anything that spayed it better? I just like resting it, not carrying anything and trying not to look behind on my shoulder. OK. So you're sleeping on the right side then? Yeah. OK. And what would you say the severity of the pain is on a scale of 1 to 10? If I'm not doing it, doing anything or not doing much, it's probably like a 2 or 3. But if I try to carry anything, it goes up to like probably like a 7. OK. And do you do any repetitive overhead activities, things like playing basketball, or just lifting things like above your head at the gym? Not recently. Just like normal weight exercises. Maybe with the bands, I do some overhead exercises. But in terms of sports, I used to play a lot of tennis. I did have some issues with the same shoulder, which is why I kind of stopped playing tennis. My doctor said I might have to open and use that shoulder. But that was like a couple of years back, so I thought it must have healed by now. OK. So previous overuse injury of the left shoulder. OK. And have you had any trauma to the shoulder? No, not that I know. OK. Have you had any fevers or chills? No. Have you had any night sweats? No. OK. Have you had any skin rashes or skin changes? No. OK. So even over the area, you haven't noticed any redness or soft tissue swelling? No. OK. Have you had any chest pain? Nope. OK. How about any shortness of breath? No, not that I've noticed. OK. Have you had pains in any other joints? No, just my shoulder. OK. And have you had any recent infections or symptoms such as like a runny nose or sore throat or even a cough? No, nothing like that. OK. And how about any nausea or vomiting? No. OK. And how has your sleep been the past couple of nights? So you mentioned you haven't been able to lay on your left side? Yeah, it's been pretty painful. I kind of wake up every time I accidentally go onto my left side. OK. Sorry. You're getting worse thing at pain at night. OK. Have you had any weakness? Do you feel like you have less strength than your arm? OK. I do feel that there might be some less strength than my left arm, but I'm not really using it much, so it's hard to tell. OK. And how about range of motion? Do you feel as though you could lift your left arm up to scratch your head and back? It does hurt when I try to lift my arm up. OK. So it sounds like range of motion is decreased. OK. And have you had an altered sensation of your arms being numbness or tingling? No. I haven't felt any of that. OK. And have you had any changes to your bowel habits, like constipation or diarrhea? No, nothing like that. Have you had any abdominal pain? No. And have you had any urinary problems? No. OK. And in the past, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions? No, I've been pretty healthy, actually. Just that overuse injury two years ago. OK. Great. And do you have any allergies to medications? No. OK. Do you take any medications regularly? Just recently, I've been taking a lot more of the hydro, but that's about it. OK. And have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries? No, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. OK. Could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently, like who you're living with and whereabouts? Yeah. So I'm living with my wife in a small condominium in downtown. OK. And are you working currently? Yeah, I'm working as a university agent. OK. And do you drink alcohol? Rarely, just on some occasions. That's about my goal, you know. OK. How about smoking cigarettes or cannabis? No, I'm never smoked. Do you use any recreational drugs or have you in the past? No. OK. And so the next part, just for that physical exam, so you have pain with shoulder abduction? Yes. Yes. So just, yeah, I do have some pain, especially from, yeah, pain throughout abduction. OK. Is there any pain that's parts of that range of motion that are more painful for you? Yeah, so probably from 60 degrees to 120 degrees, is more painful. OK. And if your arm is outstretched and you're thumb pointing down, so your arm is internally rotated, does that give you pain? OK. Um, yes. If, yeah, not just like that, but if you were to like press down on it, the internal rotation does cause a little bit of pain. OK. Um, OK. So it sounds like a positive job's test and a positive nearest test as well as a painful arc for your shoulder. And is there pain to palpation? Just, yeah, definitely just at the front of the shoulder, there's some pain over with palpation. OK. And sensation is normal, reflexes are normal. And strength is slightly reduced as well. OK. So that was everything that I wanted to ask on history and check, ask about on the physical exam as well. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention today that I may be forgot? No, I think that's it. OK. So based on the symptoms today, along with your age and prior history of an overuse injury of the left shoulder, it certainly raises concern of having an rotator cuff tear or a rotator cuff impingement syndrome where there is inflammation there and not necessarily actually a full tear of the muscle that's causing the pain. So those would be the two most likely things, yeah, the rotator cuff tear or subacromial impingement syndrome. And so we want to get an ultrasound of the left shoulder to evaluate the structures and possibly some other imaging, which is an X-ray or MRI to determine the extent of the injury in the left shoulder. OK. Sounds good. Thank you.",

    "transcription": "So I understand even experiencing some abdominal pain? Yeah, yeah, stomach hurt. It started hurting more. Last couple of days, maybe three days ago, I think. Okay. So for three days ago, for the last three days, you said it's been hurting more. Did you have pain before that? It felt weird, like crampy. I just, I either thought I was contemplated because of me. But I haven't been able to go to the bathroom as well. I just saw it kind of bloated a bit, but yeah, about that time, it started to feel a little bit more painful. Okay. Can you tell me kind of where you're feeling the pain the most? Yeah, kind of like near my right hip, like lower, where my stomach is, but kind of right and below my belly bone. Sometimes a little bit on the top, just below my belly bone, but mainly just not right lower side, yeah. Okay. Have you ever had pain like this in the past? No, never. Okay. And for the last three days, has it been pretty constant? Has it been on and off? I feel it's been getting worse to be honest. Is there anything that you think of this made it feel better? Honestly, just resting flat makes it feel a little bit better, but nothing much now. Okay. Is there anything that makes it worse? Touching it. Also, I keep the other day, and that made it definitely feel worse. Does that whole contraction of my body was nasty? Okay. Is it just the one time? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You had nausea associated with this? Mm-hmm. Okay. Does the pain stay in that same spot or does it move anywhere else? It's pretty much stayed in that one spot, yeah. Have you noticed any fever or something? It felt a bit hot the other day. Didn't take it to temperature though. Okay. Okay. And what specifically prompted you to come in today to be more into the park? I thought it was just going to get better when I first started. Maybe it's a bit of gas, but here we are kind of Thursday now, and it's still pretty bad. Okay. I mean, been in contact with anyone that's been sick lately? Not off the top of my head, no. And have you traveled anywhere? Okay. And I forgot to ask you, you notice any changes to your bowel habit? Yeah. Yeah. I was fairly regular about once a day. Five days ago, starting to be constipated, we'll get backed up pretty much the picture of. And last time I went to the bathroom was two days ago, I think. Yeah. Okay. I'm just going to ask you some questions about your overall health. Do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for? Or any other doctor? I got diabetes type two. Okay. And is that generally has up in well control for you lately? Most part, doctor checks my shoulders. I'm not too regular on them myself. But last time he changed his medications was a couple years back and I've just been on the same ones ever since. Okay. What medication are you currently taking? Metformin. Metformin. And have you given her how to be surgery? No, I help my teeth pulled as a kid. No. Okay. So you're appendix. Yeah. Yeah. I never had that problem as a kid. Okay. And do you have any allergies? No. Sometimes get a little bit congested during the fall, but that's it. Do you have any family history of doctor and personal problems? Yes. Like, no. I think my grandma died of breast cancer fairly early, but not that I can think of. Okay. And in just in terms of your lifestyle, do you live here in town? Yeah. Yeah. I live a little in a root family. No, I got family. Me to life. I got two kids, one of them's college, now, with them. Yeah. Nice. And what do you do for work? Or are you retired? I'm still working. I'm a production overseer, a production manager, over at Fairbanks. Oh, okay. You're a big boss. I took a while to get here. I'm sure it was very hard work. In general, do you drink alcohol? Oh, yeah. Well, I'm like, well, I'm planning on drinking on the two four, but, oh, regular special occasions, being hot days. Sometimes I'll have a beer too. Here. And do you smoke cigarettes? No. I haven't been able to smoke in the past. No. Okay, do you use cannabis? No. Okay, any other substances? No. Okay. Is there anything else you wanted to bring up today that I didn't ask you about? Or any other questions that you have? No. Just open a good answer to whatever's going on. Okay. Okay. Well, at this point, I will do a quick physical exam. We might want to have blood work done. Maybe some other tests based on what we find out from there. And then we can kind of let you know after that what the next steps will be. So I'm just going to take this and go over with the solution that I'm working with. And we'll talk you short. Thanks for talking with us. Thanks, Doc.",

And sorry, when did you say it started? So if we're going on for, well, it's gotten really intense in the last two days. OK. And before that, did you have anything at all or was it just like sun? Yeah, I do have a bit of pain down in my end-in-night blood-uck area. But it's just gotten really more painful over these last couple of days. OK. And is it a persistent kind of pain or does it come and go? It's persistent. It does get worse though, depending on what I'm doing. OK. When does it get worse? It gets worse with walking, with sitting really any kinds of movements. I just kind of stay still. And that's the only thing that really helps it. OK. Have you tried anything for it? Yeah. I've just stated in some pain medications over the counter for these last couple of days like that Abil and Pylonol, but that's it. OK. And is it helping? It does. I mean, not really. It hasn't really helped much. OK. And if you were to describe the quality of the pain, would you say it's sharp, dull, achy, throbby? It's like kind of like a sharp pain in the and the butt arc. And it's kind of like burning down the leg. OK. OK. So I would take your kind of pain. And then OK. And if you were to rate the severity of your pain, 1 to 10, 10, being the worst pain you've ever felt, what would you rate it? 8. OK. And does this pain radiate elsewhere? I know you said it starts on your butt, it kind of goes down your legs. Does it go up your back or down into the other leg at all? No. I feel it just on the butt, I can down the legs. OK. Have you ever experienced this kind of pain before? I have, yeah. I'm a truck driver. And so I do a lot of sitting. And I've had kind of sciatic pain in the past. OK. And have you ever had any trauma or anything that could have triggered this initially in the past? No, I don't think so. I haven't really done much. I just kind of worked and yeah, I haven't had any trauma to the back or anything like that. OK. And are you experiencing any sort of weakness with your legs? No. No weakness. Just while I'm... Yeah, I guess maybe a little bit of leg weakness. I've had a little bit of difficulty walking, but limping. Oh, I see. OK. OK. And just in your right legs, right? Yeah. Any urinary or stool incontinence? No. No. OK. Any sexual dysfunction? No, I haven't had anything like that. OK. Any numbness or tingling? Yeah. I've had some numbness and tingling down the right leg. OK. Have it in the groin area. No. It's just kind of down the back of my leg. OK. All right. And otherwise, do you have any other symptoms? No, it's just been just been this pain. OK. All right. And I'll just kind of go through some questions with you. Do you have any joint pains with muscle aches? Outslur? No. No weight loss? No weight loss? Feevers or chills? No fevers or chills? Rashes? And no rashes? Changes to your region hearing smell or taste? No. Are you coughing? I'm sure it has a breath or breathing? No. I haven't been having any symptoms like that. OK. Any chest pain, palpitations or dizziness or fainting spells? No. Nothing like that. OK. Anything just your bowel movements? No diarrhea or constipation? And no bleeding in the stool? No blood in the stool. And then how about nausea or vomiting? No. I haven't had any nausea or vomiting. OK. Changes to your urine? No. No changes to your urine. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding medical conditions? I do have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. And I take medications for those. I take amlotypine and a statin. OK. Do you have any other medical conditions? Are you on any other medications? The side's those? I just have a multivitamin. OK. And are you up to date with all your immunizations? I am, yes. OK. Any allergies? No, I don't believe so. No. Family issue of musculoskeletal or neurological issues? No. Nothing like that. Autoimmune conditions? No. Nothing like that. Cancer? No. No, OK. And do you smoke? Yeah, I smoke about half a pack of cigarettes per day. OK. For how long have you been doing that? For about 40 years. 40 years? OK. Have you ever thought of quitting? I have. Yeah. I've caught down over the years. I use to smoke more. It's just the culture with, I don't know, everybody's driving a truck and smoking. OK. Yeah, that's hard. If you ever need any resources, we have some that we can refer you to. Thank you. Yeah, no worries. And do you consume marijuana? No, I don't. OK. Have what other recreational drugs? No. Nothing like that before. OK. Do you drink alcohol? Yeah, I'll have a beer to you on the weekend, so maybe a couple of drinks per week. OK. And how about do you do a sick contest? Have you been in touch with any recently? No, I haven't been around anybody who's been sick. OK. Any travel recently? Just for the drop-offs that I make driving. I do have to make some pretty long halls back and forth. Yeah. OK. And where do you currently live? So I live in a house with my wife and son. OK. All right. And OK. So now I'm just going to move on to the physical exam part of this. And I'm going to ask you to do a few things. OK. So just by looking at your legs or if you have a mirror and you can look at your right buttock area, do you see any swelling or redness? No, I don't see anything like that. OK. And does it feel hot? No, it doesn't feel hot. OK. And do you see any skin changes? No skin changes. Any atrophy or deformity in the area? No. No. Has your date changed? Are you limping, hobbling, anything like that? Yeah, I feel like I've been limping a little bit. Yeah. Are you putting more pressure on the left foot then? I am. Yeah. Yeah. I guess it's like an entailed rigate. OK. All right. And then if you press down on your hip bone, do you feel any pain there on your right hip bone? No, I don't. OK. How about when you press down on your buttocks itself? I, yeah. There is a little bit of tenderness over the buttock area. OK. How about the back of your legs? No. How about there? OK. How about the front of your like size? No. No? OK. All right. And then I'm going to just get you to do a few movements with me as well. Would you ask, OK, so are you sitting down right now? Yeah. OK. Would you mind standing up from a sitting position? Yeah, for sure. Does that hurt? Yeah, that causes pain. OK. So that causes it. So on hip extension, that causes some pain. And as well as knee extension. So would you mind kicking your right leg up in front of you all the way up as far as you can go? Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. It does, yeah. So right hip flexion also causes pain. And then would you mind folding your knees backwards and just sort of flexing it? Does that hurt? No. OK. So no pain on knee flexion. And have a when you point your feet and toes up towards the ceiling. Yeah. Yeah. I do get some pain when my, yeah, when that's all straightened out. Yeah. OK. So some pain on plantar flexion at the right foot. And have it if you point your feet and toes towards the ground. No pain there. OK. All right. And have a when you kick your legs to the side and upwards. Oh, no pain with abduction. OK. So no pain on right hip abduction. And then how about when you bring it back down? No. OK. And no pain on hip abduction. OK. Well, those were all the questions that I have for you. Do you have any questions from myself? Just wondering about possibly like what it could be. Yeah. So it sounds right now like you may have some sort of a sacral nerve ridiculous epithee or like a lower lung bar ridiculous epithee. And basically that's known as sciatica where your nerve roots can become pressed causing some of these symptoms. And to diagnose these things, usually it's just done by history and physical exam. But if after we try out some management things, it doesn't go away or you're having some red flags, including numbness in the groin area, bowel or bladder and continents, then we can look at some imaging for the spine, including MRI. And so in terms of management of this, we can try a couple of like conservative approaches first. So that includes taking NSAIDs for the pain and then like activity modification. So if you're sitting down all the time, perhaps like taking little breaks, stretching out your legs, doing some physio as well during those breaks can help. And as well, I'm going to give you a referral for physical therapy. And they'll do some exercises with you and slowly increase those exercises. And if those still don't work, we can try steroids, steroid injections as well. We talked about the imaging if it doesn't go away in about six to eight weeks. Does that sound OK? Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. OK, yeah, no problem.",

    "transcription": "45 year old female with right knee pain. Hi, my name is Chris. I'm a medical student in the clinics today. How may I help you? Hi, Chris. So I'm just having this pain in my knee since I just fell this three days ago slipping on the stairs. Since then I've been having a lot of pain. I see. So did this pain start right after falling on the stairs? Yeah, I've been having the pain since then. Okay. That was three days ago. Three years ago. Okay. And you're feeling the pain in your right knee? Yeah, in my right knee. Okay. And what would you say the character of the pain is, or how would you describe the pain? It's kind of like a dull, aging pain. Okay. And has the pain been getting any better or any worse? It's kind of getting worse, actually, just in my right knee, as well as my whole right calf as well. Okay. What is the intensity of the pain on a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you've ever felt? Probably around the six. Okay. And did your knee hurt before this at all? Or did you have any trauma to the leg before? No, no. Before three days ago, before my slip, I was fine. Okay. Are you feeling the pain anywhere else besides your right knee? In my calf, I'm getting a lot of pain as well in my right calf. Okay. Is there been anything that's made the pain worse? Yeah, if I am walking or if I'm moving that leg and putting weight on it, it's definitely worse. So it's definitely like better if I just stay seated and stay resting. Okay. Is there anything, excuse me, resting? Is there anything else that's helped? I did take some, which did help for a few hours, but then it just kind of ran back to the same. Okay. And have you had any associated symptoms with the right knee and calf pain? Yes, I also think there's some swelling in my right calf as well since yesterday. Okay. Okay. There's some swelling there. Have you noticed if your calf was red or if there was a rash over it? I don't see any rashes or redness, but it definitely does seem swollen and then it hurts as well when I move it or press it. Okay. And when you felt, did you injure any other parts of your body like your hands or wrists? Just a few scratches on my hands, but nothing too bad. And how about your head? Did you lose consciousness or hit your head? No, no, I didn't hit my head at all. I caught myself before then and no, I didn't lose any consciousness. Okay. Okay. Have you had any fevers or chills? No. Okay. Have you had any chest pain? No. Have you had any cough? No cough. Have you had any shortness of breath? No. Okay. Have you had any dizziness or lightheadedness? No. Okay. And have you had any heart palpitations or feeling like your heart is racing? No, nothing like that. Okay. And have you had any infectious symptoms such as like a runny nose or sore throat? No, nothing like that. Okay. And have you had any nausea vomiting? No. Have you had any abdominal pain? No. Okay. Have you had any changes to your bowel movements like diarrhea or more constipation? No. Nothing like that. All right. So have you had any urinary problems? No. All right. Have you had any recent weight changes? No. Nothing like that. Okay. And have you noticed any... It rashes anywhere else over your whole body? No, not that. I've noticed. All right. Have you noticed any muscle weakness? No. Have you had any numbness to the skin? No. Not that I've noted, no. And have you had any tingling? No. Okay. And... In the past, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions? I do have some high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I see. And do you take any medications? Yes. A cholesterol. I'm taking like a crestermedication. And then a high blood pressure I'm taking a ramopro. Okay. Have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries before? No. I... No, I don't... Just besides a... A C-section for one of my children. I don't have any other surgeries. Okay. And have you had any thrombosis before or a blood clot in the past? No. I've never had anything like that. Okay. And have you been... So you've had the birth of your... You had a C-section. And have you been pregnant other times in the past? No. That was it. Okay. So have you had a miscarriage before? No. Okay. Any allergies to medications? No allergies. Okay. And... Could you tell me a little bit about your... Living situation currently, like you're living with. Whereabouts are you living? Yeah, I live with my husband and our daughter. And it's just in a small townhouse just in the city. Okay. And are you working currently? I do work from home. I'm actually just... I'm in a counting clerk, but I'm also my work is from home right now. Okay. And any exposures to anybody who's been sick? No. Have you traveled anywhere recently? No. Okay. And over the last couple of days, with the leg pain, do you feel as though you've been like immobilized? Yeah. I've been trying to just stay rested, just stay seated, otherwise it hurts a lot, especially after my fall. So I've tried to stay immobilized. Okay. For the last couple of days. Okay. And do you drink alcohol? No. And do you smoke cigarettes? No. No. I don't. I don't. I don't. No, I don't. Okay. Okay. So... Oh, and in the family, are there any history of heart or lung conditions? So, don't know about heart or lung conditions, but my mother had a stroke in her late 60s. My father is pretty healthy. Okay. Has there been any blood clots in the family before? I'm not sure about blood clots, but my mother had a stroke. Is that kind of like a blood clot? It could be. I stroke can have many different types of causes for it, and one of them could be caused by a blood clot, but I wouldn't be able to say for sure, just because there are so many different types or reasons for having a stroke. Okay. So, yeah, so you mentioned your leg has some swelling. Do you feel as though there's any... Like temperature change to your calf? Like, is it hot? I think... I don't know if it's maybe a little bit warm, but definitely swollen. And do you feel... Is there any pain to palpation? Like, if you touch your calf or something like that, is there pain? Yeah, if I touch my right calf, it's painful, and then if I press down on it, it's really painful. And then just on the outside of my right knee, if I touch or press down, it really hurts as well. Okay. And if you move your foot, so if you dorsiflex your ankle, or bending your toe up towards your nose, do you end up getting any calf pain? It's doing that at the whole moment test? Yeah, I'll try that out. I think it definitely hurts when I move my... I don't know if I could point my toes towards my nose. Okay. Okay, so I think... That was everything that I wanted to ask today on history. Was there anything else that maybe I missed? No, I think that's all. Okay. All right, so with the fall two days ago, things that I'm thinking about right now would be possibly a muscle strain, so this could be a gastrocnemius strain to the calf muscle itself, from the fall, which could have pain when you touch it, it could be some swelling, and it would be aggravated by movements. Also could be injuries to some of the ligaments there, as well. And however, with the swelling, the immobilization for the last two days, as well as the pain kind of being a bit progressive, with swelling and a positive home and test, and your temperature is a little bit elevated today, not quite a fever, but feverish. It does increase the suspicion for a deep vein thrombosis. And so I think the most likely thing right now is actually a DVT or deep vein thrombosis. And so we will order some diagnostic studies and get an ultrasound of your right calf, as well as an x-ray of the right knee to start. Okay. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you so much.",

    "transcription": "I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in to the emergency department today. Yeah, so nice to meet you. I've been having this pain right in my abdomen. It's kind of like in the upper right area. Okay. And so where is this pain located exactly? No, it's just in the upper right corner and I haven't even laid below where the lungs are. And yet it just, I have this severe pain that's going on. Okay. And how long has it been going on for? So it's been going on for the last few days and it got worse today. Okay. And how long has it been since it's like got worse. Does it been a few hours or how long has that been? So I would say it got worse just three or four hours ago before I came to the emergency department. Okay. And does the pain radiate anywhere? No, it stays right in the spot that I told you right in the right upper corner. Okay. And when did the pain start? Or if you could tell me what were you doing right prior to the pain starting? So I think it started after just three days ago after I had a meal. I think it was after lunch around half an hour or an hour after lunch. I see. Okay. It has the pain gotten worse, stayed the same or gotten better since yesterday. I think it's gone. It was, it's the worst today, like especially a few hours ago, three hours ago. It was much worse than the other two days. Okay. And how would you describe the character or the quality of the pain? So it's like a sharp, I would describe it as like a sharp pain. Okay. And on a scale of one to ten, ten being the most severe pain, what would you rate it as? I would rate it as, right now I'd rate it as an eight. Okay. And has anything like this happened to you before? I think it happened to me a few years back where I had this pain and then it just kind of went away on its own. I didn't go to the emergency department then though. Okay. And has there been anything that you've tried to make this pain any better? I tried taking just like Advil and Tylenol, but it didn't really seem to help the pain too much. Okay. And have you had any other associated symptoms such as nausea or vomiting? I've had some nodural over the past few days, but I haven't vomited anything. Okay. So no blood in your MSS or no vomiting at all? Yeah. Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently? You don't like me having traveled anywhere recently? Okay. And how has your energy level been? Energy, when it's hurting a lot like today, it's been difficult to move around in pretty trained from the pain, but otherwise over the last few days it hasn't affected me too much, but today I would say my energy levels are down. Okay. And have you noticed any skin changes or any rashes? I don't think so. I mean, I don't think I've noticed any kind of skin changes. Okay. And how about any changes to urinary habits like painful urination or the color of your urine? No. No changes. Okay. And have you had any changes to bowel patterns such as diarrhea or changes in color of your stool? No. I don't think so. No changes that I've noticed. Okay. So, any notice any blood in the stool? No. No blood. Okay. And how has your appetite been? It was around the same before the pain actually started getting worse. So, today I didn't really feel like eating. I did have nausea with Ascuti, but my appetite I would say the worst today. Okay. And have you noticed any changes to your weight recently? No. I don't think so. Okay. And have you had any recent infections? No. Not that I know. No. Okay. So, next just to ask some questions about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past? So, I think the only thing is my doctor told me that I should lose some weight, but other than that, I know medical history. Okay. Any allergies to medications? No allergies. And are there any medications that you take on a regular basis, either prescribed or over the counter? Not prescribed. Sometimes I take like some antacids when I get a heartburn, but this is just like a couple times a month after dinner. Sometimes I'm not about it. Okay. And any hospitalizations? Just for just when I had my children at the time of their birth, but that's it. Okay. And have you been around anybody who's been sick? No. Okay. And have you had any prior surgeries? No. No, no prior surgeries. Okay. And any family history of... Uh, called bladder disease or cardiovascular disease in the family? So my father died of a stroke when he was in his 60s. My mother does have gallstones. Okay. And what do you do for work? So I work in at the bank. Okay. Consulted. Okay. And do you drink alcohol? Uh, yes, sometimes. Okay. Maybe one or two glasses of wine every night. Okay. Do you feel the need to cut down on your drinking? Uh, no, not really. Okay. Have you ever felt in the way to apply people criticizing your drinking? No. Okay. Have you felt guilty about your drinking? Uh, no. Should I be? Uh, no. But at this time, just wanting to gauge a sense of how you feel about your drinking levels at this time. And if all what question to that would be, have you ever felt the need to have a drink early in the morning? Uh, no, no, I'm never drink. I don't know if I'm drinking to the morning. No. Okay. Uh, do you use recreational drugs? Uh, no, not really. Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes? Nope. And, um, uh, and then, um, who are you living with currently at home? Uh, so I'm living with my two children and, uh, my partner. And could you talk me a little bit about the home situation? Yeah, the home situation is fine. Like, uh, kids are doing great and the partner is very supportive. Um, knowing all the issues that I can think about home. Okay. Excellent.",

Yeah. When did this, when did this pain start? It was about three days ago. Three days ago? Okay. Where exactly in your chest do you feel it? It's kind of right here, right over my heart, I think. That's where it's the worst kind. Okay. And is it, what kind of pain is it? Is it more like a dull pressure pain or is it a sharp bean? How would you describe it? I'd say a sharp bean. A sharp bean? Okay. And so it started three days ago, has it been coming and going or has it been constant? It just lasts for a few seconds and then it goes away. Okay. And does the pain come on when you're doing any activities or when does the pain usually come on? It's usually worse when I'm coughing or I'm lying down. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And does it improve with any positional changes at all or anything that you do that does it helps? When I lean forward, it actually does get better. I think about it. Yeah. Okay. And has this ever happened to you before? No. No, it hasn't. Okay. And on a scale of one to ten, one being at least someone of pain you felt and ten being the worst, how much would you rate it? I feel it's excited to. Okay. And does the pain move anywhere on your chest or does it stay in the same spot? Yeah. I think it kind of goes to my neck sometimes. And do you have any other symptoms like do you have any shortness of breath, the dizziness, anything like that? No. I don't want to. Any, okay. Any, any palpitations? Nope. Okay. Nothing. And I don't know that. Have you been having any other symptoms at all besides the pain? No, no, nothing else. I just have these short exosophane that last a couple of seconds. Have you tried any medications that has helped the pain? Yeah. I took some, I took some Tylenol and that did help. Okay. It took it once yesterday. Right. Any recent injuries to the area like you haven't falls or anything like that? No. No, I haven't. Okay. Any headaches, some nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills? Any of those symptoms? Nope. Okay. Any cough, runny nose, any viral symptoms? No, well, not right now, but I did have a flu last week. I had a fever, had a runny nose. I did have a bit of a cough, and I was feeling super tired. But not anymore, I'm okay now. Okay. And have you at all had any dizziness or have you fainted at all? No. Okay. Have you been noticing any kind of weakness or numbness? Nope. Nope. Okay. In terms of your post medical history, do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, any other diagnosis? No, I'm a pretty healthy 25 year old. Okay. Do you take any medications? I sometimes take Tylenol. Okay. And any allergies at all? Nope. Okay. And any previous surgeries? No, no, no, no. Third phase. Do you have any family history of any heart conditions or any cancers or any other complex? Yeah. My father, he had a heart attack two weeks ago and he passed away. And I'm worried I'm having heart attack, too. Was this two weeks ago? Yeah. I'm so sorry to hear that. And it must be really difficult time for you right now. Okay. So you're worried you might be having a heart attack as well? Yeah. Okay. So we can definitely do some tests and see what's going on. I just have a few more questions and then I'll just get to some of the management and what we'll be doing for you in the future. So currently right now, do you work at all? No, I'm a student. I, well, at the part that I'm job, I do work as a postman. Okay. And where are you a student? What do you do? I'm studying engineering at Western. And currently, where do you live? Do you live in student housing, apartment, or... I live up in my parents. Well, my mom now. Going to house. All right. And do you drink at all alcohol? I've been occasionally maybe wanted to drinks on the weekends. And any recreational drug use like marijuana or cocaine? No. And do you smoke? No. All right. So those are all the questions we had for you today. And it must be really difficult and scary for you right now. But we'll make sure to get to the bottom of this. See what's going on. So what we can do is get you an ECG to see how your heart is functioning. And then see get a new blood work we needed for the future. But yeah, right now I would say try not to worry too much about it right now and see what some of those tests come back. Thank you. So yeah, you're welcome.",

    "transcription": "I was wondering if you could tell us what brought you into CS. Yeah, so I just came in and I was a bit worried because I've been having this cough for around two years, which has been getting worse. But recently I've noticed that I see streaks of blood in this put on that I'm producing before just used to be like white. And now I'm seeing over the last, I would say two months, occasionally, some streaks of blood. Okay. And the cough started two years ago. Yeah. Okay. And it's been gradually getting worse over that time. Yeah, I would say so. It's getting more frequent and worse in nature. Okay. And how much speed of are you bringing up in a day? Probably like a couple of teaspoons. Okay. And is are you seeing like bright red blood when you're when you're coughing it up? In this, it's kind of mixed into this put on, I would say like, but it definitely is red. Okay. And how much blood would you say that you're you're bringing up with the teaspoons or a cup or no, it's just like a little streaks. It's not really significant. It doesn't feel like the whole production of this put on, but just like little streaks that up knows this. Okay. And is the cough worse at any particular time of day? It definitely gets worse when I'm doing more activities. And then also when I get like some viral infections, but other than that, it's pretty much always there. Okay. Anything that makes it worse, I use it said some viral infections. You have you had a viral infection recently? Yeah. Like in the last two years, I've probably had two or three viral infections. This just cold, cold symptoms. Has there been anything that you've tried to make the cough better? I've tried the time cold. Has it really worked? Tried to just other over the counter medications haven't really worked? Okay. And prior to two years ago, were you experiencing any similar symptoms like this cough for bringing up blood before in the past? I've always had somewhat of a cough like I have COPD. Okay. So I've always had a little bit of a cough here and there, but over the last two years, I feel that it's been getting much worse. Okay. Have you been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis before? Yeah, I think so. Okay. And so with this cough and now blood tinged, have you been experiencing any other symptoms? I do feel sometimes I get like more tired than I used to throughout the day. Okay. Sometimes I also feel more breathless when I'm exerting myself more. Okay. And have you been having any fevers or chills? No, no, I haven't. How about any night sweats? No. Have you lost any weight? Yeah, I've actually lost a significant amount of weight I would say. But then the last one and a half month, probably lost like eight to ten pounds. Okay. Have you been trying to lose weight? No, not really. I've just been sitting around like I can barely walk that much anymore to I used to be able to walk at least 400 meters around the block. But now I can barely even go to the kitchen. Okay. Is this because of the shortness of breath when you are exerting? Yeah, that and I just start coughing so much that I just have to sit down. Okay. And have you been having any headaches? No headaches. All right. And how about and how's your appetite been? I think it's been pretty much the same. Sometimes I'm coughing a lot. I don't feel like eating, but I'm not that it's been around the same. Okay. Any nausea or vomiting? No. Any runny nose or sore throat? Nope. Okay. And then how about a loss of smell or a loss of taste? No, nothing like that. Okay. Have you been having any chest pain? No. Any heart palpitations? No. Any wheezing when you're breathing? Sometimes I would say like when when it gets worse when I'm exerting myself more, I can get some reason. Okay. And have you noticed any swelling in your feet or ankles? No, nothing like that. All right. And have you woken up at night extremely short of breath? No, I'm pretty fine during the night. All right. And have you been having any abdominal pain? No. Any urinary problems? No. Any bowel problems like diarrhea or constipation? No, nothing like that. All right. Any skin rashes? No. Any joint pains or muscle pains? No. Any weakness? Not weakness. I'll just say more fatigue. All right. So I know you told me COPD, but do you have any other medical diagnoses? Yeah, I have high blood pressure as well. All right. I think I have high cholesterol too. I see. Okay. Do you take any medications regularly? Yeah. So the cholesterol I'm taking, those overstats in. And I forget what I'm taking for the blood pressure, but it's pretty well under control. Okay. You use any inhalers for COPD? I used to, I used to have, I think like three different inhalers, but haven't had to use them for two more than 10 years now. Okay. What was the reason for not needing them anymore? I just didn't have any symptoms for a pretty long time. And my docs said like, if I don't really need them, then I can just stop. Okay. And have you had any recent hospitalizations? No. Any allergies to medications? Nope. Any surgeries that you've had in the past? No surgeries. Okay. And are your vaccinations up to date? Yep. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about your social situation or living situation? Yeah. So currently I'm just living by myself in an apartment. I've been there for more than 10 years now. I'm retired, so I'm not working anymore. Yeah, that's me. Okay. Great. What did you do previously for work? Did you have any exposures for two chemicals or dusts or asbestos? Things like that nature? Oh, yes. So I worked in the steel factory for most of my working life. I think there might have been some exposures to chemicals and dust particles. Asbestos, I don't think there was exposure, but definitely I may have lived in places that had asbestos. Yeah. Okay. How long have you been living where you've been now? So this is like the one I'm living in as a new place, but before that, I've lived in another apartment for around five years, and that was a pretty old building. Okay. Do you have any pets? No pets, no. Okay. Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes? Yeah, I smoke, I'll say, around 20 cigarettes a day right now. All right. And did you smoke more previously? Yeah, I think I've been smoking for almost like 40 years now, and I used to smoke up to 30 cigarettes a day. Okay. Do you smoke cannabis? No. All right. And do you drink alcohol? Just maybe a couple of times a month. No, nothing, nothing throughout the week. Okay. So do you use any recreational drugs like IV drugs or opioids or co-sale? No, nothing like that. All right. And anybody in the family have any similar symptoms before, like coughing up blood or I know, not that I know my father passed away from a heart attack when he was in his 60s. And I think my mother had, like, I think one of the, like an arthritis. Yeah. But I think that was just like the one that you get with old age. Okay. Like, osteoarthritis? Yeah, that was the one. Okay. Any cancers in the family? Um, not that one of my own cause has like a bladder cancer, but that's that's about it. Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently or been around any sick contacts? Possibly people, anybody who's had tuberculosis or any infections? No, I've been pretty much to myself over the last few months, so not really. Okay. Um, was there anything that you were worried that this could be? Uh, yeah, just the blood, I kind of got scared, maybe I thought, you know, what if it's a cancer? Um, one of my friends had lung cancer. And I know I've been smoking for most of my life, so that's something I was worried about. Um, I can certainly see the the concern and I understand where you're coming from. Um, I think it would be very reasonable to investigate that today. Um, so we'll start with, um, uh, HSCT, um, along with, uh, some lab work, you'll get a CBC and some electrolytes. Um, also get an ECG as well if they just check your heart. And, um, we will, uh, see what the investigations show. Sounds good. Okay. And, um, other things that, uh, to think about, um, this could be, uh, also, like the COPD, uh, I know it's been going on a long time, but, um, possibly could have a pneumonia that's been lingering on, particularly if it's a fungal type of, uh, infection as well as, um, things like you mentioned, you possibly unsure if you've had an asbestos exposure in the past and stuff like that can possibly lead to, um, scarring of the lung. And so all of these, factors will be looked into. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you so much. All right. You're welcome. Thank you.",

    "transcription": "My back is just really hurts. I feel really stiff in the morning. And yeah, it's just been going on for a few months now. Okay, so for a few months, stiffness in the morning. So your back hurts, where exactly would you say it hurts? It kinda hurts all over. I can't really pinpoint any specific locations that hurt most. It kinda hurts all down my back. Okay, all the way up to, I guess, your neck and all the way down to your lower back. I wouldn't really say the neck. I guess more of the lower parts, maybe the middle of my back and down. Okay, and what kind of pain would you say it is? Is it like a dull aching pain? Is it a sharp stabbing pain? How would you describe it? It's a dull pain. Dull pain, okay. And on a scale of 0 to 10, would there be an elis amount of pain you felt in your life and 10 being the worst? How much would you rate it? It's about a four or five. I mean, some days it can be better, but, yeah, some days it can be worse. Okay. And when did this start? I think this started about four or five months ago. It's been going on, yeah, for probably about half a year now. Okay. And when it first started, was there anything that caused the back pain, like any kind of trauma or injury, anything that you can think of that might have led to this? No, nothing that I can think of. It's sort of, it's come on so slowly, like when I first started noticing the back pain, it was maybe like a zero to a one. I didn't really notice it too much, but over these last five, six months, it has gotten a bit worse. Okay, so it kind of came on progressively. It didn't just come on suddenly at some point. Right, yeah, it's been getting worse. Okay. And have you ever had any previous episodes that are similar to this? Not my back pain. I do get pain in my right knee and in my hands sometimes, but those pains just kind of come and go. Okay, when did those pains start? Those ones started probably, ever similar timeline around six months ago. Okay. Okay, and the back pain that you're having, does it radiate or move to any other part of your body? No, I don't feel it anywhere else. Okay, and have you tried anything that has helped relieve some of the pain in medications or anything? Yeah, I've tried some Tylenol and Advil and the Advil's actually helped taking the adjocl a little bit, but the next morning, I have the stiffness and pain again. Okay. And for your pain, are there any kind of factors that make the pain worse, like bending down or standing straight up or laying down anything that makes your pain worse? No, nothing that I can think of that really makes it any worse. Okay. And is your pain worse when you wake up in the morning or is it worse as the day progresses? It's worse in the morning. It gets a bit better as the day goes on. I ask you about an hour into the day, I feel my best. It takes a little bit of time to move around a little bit first. Okay, and approximately how much time would you say after you wake up the stiffness and pain goes away? I would say maybe 30 to 60 minutes. Okay. All right. And you haven't had any trauma injuries in recent years? No trauma or injuries. Okay. And no fevers or chills? No. Okay. Any night sweats? No. Any fatigue or malaise? Yeah, I have been a bit more fatigue than usual. And yeah, I've had some malaise as well. And for how long have you had this? It's been similarly getting a little bit more progressive. I mean, some days I'm just feeling like I just want to lay around and rest because I'm feeling just so burnt out and other days I'm okay, but I'm certainly more tired than usual. Okay, let's see. Other than that, have you noticed any kind of rashes or skin changes or changes in your nails at all? No. I haven't noticed any rashes or any nail changes. Okay. Any shortness of breath? No. Any changes in your bowel movements or urinary patterns? No, I haven't had any diarrhea or any urinary problems. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements or urinary patterns? No, I haven't had any diarrhea or any urinary problems. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight? No, my appetite's been normal and my weight's been stable. Okay. And have you noticed any difficulties or changes with your vision or any eye problems? No, I haven't noticed anything like that. Okay. Have you noticed any kind of numbness or tingling sensation or your limbs specifically like your back and your legs? No, no tingling or numbness. Okay. Any muscle weakness at all? No, I haven't noticed any muscle weakness. Okay. And have you been sick at all recently with any viral or bacterial infractions? I had, I mean, I was diarrhea like several months ago and I had some antibiotics, but that was it. Yeah, so a few months ago. Okay. And other than that, currently are you sexually active? Yes, I am. I have a girlfriend and we started dating about six months ago. Okay. And do either of you have any history of any STIs at all? No history of STIs. Okay. All right. And is your partner fine or is she having any symptoms at all? No, she hasn't been having any symptoms and we've been using a condom mostly. Okay. Right. And otherwise, are you generally healthy or do you have any medical conditions? Yeah, I'm generally, I do have asthma actually. And just I had diarrhea a few months ago after eating at a buffet. So I think maybe it was food poisoning or maybe something like that. But yeah, so asthma and that's it. And do you use any medications for your asthma? Yeah, I'll use the blue inhaler. Sometimes I guess the just when I need it. But that hasn't been very often. Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications or any environmental factors? I do have environmental allergies. I'm not sure if it's like regweed or pollen, but something like that. Okay. And have you had any hospitalizations or previous surgeries? Never. Okay. Any family history of any medical conditions, any autoimmune conditions or any musculoskeletal conditions? Yeah, my mother has a psoriasis. Okay. Yeah. So she's had to, I don't use like creams and stuff like that for her skin. Okay. And currently right now, do you work? I do, yeah. I work at a bank. Okay. And your mother says she had psoriasis. Did she ever have any control? Did she have all kinds of psoriasis? I don't believe so. I think she had just issues with her skin. Okay. And so you work and then what's her living situation? Yeah. So I live with my girlfriend in a condo in the city here. Okay. And do you use any rectory food drugs like marijuana? Yes, sometimes. Yeah, I also smoke at once or twice per week with a friend or something like that. Okay. And do you smoke? No cigarettes, no. Never. Okay. And do you drink alcohol? Sometimes you all have a beer two on weekends or a cocktail with friends. Okay. All right. So those were just some of the questions I had. Now I'm just going to quickly ask some specific questions. So have you noticed any kind of swelling in the areas that you are having pain or redness or anything like that? No, I haven't noticed really any redness or swelling. Okay. And no. So are you able to bend down and stand up straight or extend backwards without pain or are you in any pain? Okay. I do get a bit stiff. I... Yeah, I'm not really too sure. Like not really. It's more stiff. Okay. And yeah, other than that, do you have any questions or concerns? Yeah, I was just wondering. Yeah, like what this could be possibly? Yeah, so definitely what... So this seems like it started of like three months to six months ago and it's been going on and it's happening in the morning. How old did you say you were? I'm 2026. Okay. Yeah, so in a team's progressive and you're getting some pain and your other joints as well. And it's mainly from your middle to lower back. It can be multiple things that you would have to rule out. So first you have a family history of psoriasis so it can be psoriatric arthritis. You don't have any other skin changes or any other symptoms. It can also be since you have had a... You were sick four months ago with what might be gastroenteritis. It can be... Sometimes a few months afterwards you can get something called the active arthritis where you get this progressive pain and your joints and stiffness. And otherwise it can also be something called enter losing spondylitis which can present in your age and it's kind of like a progressive doll back pain and that has some morning stiffness as well. So yeah, there's definitely multiple things that it can be. So first we would need to do a full physical examination and book an appointment for that in person. And we'll get some lab work done as well as an x-ray of the spine and your sacral aliac joints. And we'll also get some blood work with CBC, CRP and ESR. So those are just inflammatory markers as well as the rheumatoid factor and can you clear antibodies. So there's just some things that will test for a different kind of rheumatoid-logical issues and to see if you have any arthritis. So yeah, those are... And then we'll also get an x-ray of your hands and knees since you're having pain there as well. So yeah, those are some steps that will take... Do you have any questions or things, James? No, that sounds great. Thank you. All right, yeah. So we'll get in touch with you shortly. Sounds great. Thank you. All right, take care. All right. Bye.",

    "transcription": "what brings you in here today? Yeah, hi. I'm... I have a baby in my belly. It started a couple hours ago. Okay, and where exactly in your belly do you have this pain? It's mostly up here on the right side. On the right side? Yeah. And can you describe what kind of pain is? Is it like a dollopene, a sharp pain, an aching pain? Ah! I guess it's an aching pain I'd say. It kind of just... it would initially just come and go. But now it's just... it's staying. It's not going away. Okay. And so it's in the right area. Does it travel anywhere else where besides it? From the right side? No. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least amount of pain you're felt in your life and 10 being the worst. How much would you rate it right now? It's about a... an aching. An aching? Okay. And so just to clarify when did it start? So about eight hours ago? Eight hours ago. And were you doing anything before? Like did you have a meal or how were you asleep and it woke you up? What was going on before you had the pain? I was just about to go to sleep. I wasn't doing anything in the takeover at the time. Okay. And has it been getting worse since it first started? Oh yeah. And it would come and go... But now for the past, I'd say five to six hours, it's been constant. It's just there all the time. Okay. And have you had any similar pain like this in the past? Yeah. I have a thing being that sort of comes and goes after I eat. Usually after I've had something like a... something fatty, something from outdoors, maybe like a burger or fries or something. I initially thought it was indigestion, but I don't know what's going on now. Okay. And does anything make it better or worse? Anything that you've tried? Well, I guess eating sometimes makes it worse. But I don't think there's anything that's making it better. Okay. Have you tried any meditations at all? I tried Tylenol, but that didn't do anything. And besides the pain that you're having, do you have any nausea or vomiting? I am a little nauseous, but no, I haven't... I haven't vomiting yet, no. Okay. And have you been having any fevers? I don't think so. I haven't checked. But I don't think it's feverish. Any sweats or like chills? No. I don't think so. Okay. Any changes in your bowel movements like constipation diarrhea? No. Okay. Have you traveled the... have you ever recently? No, I haven't. Have you been feeling at all very tired, not your usual self, fatigue? Well, the pain is making you difficult for me to do things. But I guess I'm not a little bit deep, baby. Okay. Have you been having any changes in your urinary patterns? No. Any changes in your skin, any rashes, any yellowing of your skin? Nothing that I've noticed. No, I don't think so. Okay. Any changes in your urine color? No. Okay. Have you noticed blood in your stool, at all? I have not. Okay. And how about your appetite? Has this changed at all? Well, I guess because this pain happens, usually happens after I eat, I think I've been eating less than usual. Just because I don't want to, you know, I don't like the pain. Okay. Any significant weight loss recently? I don't think so. Any recent infections recently at all? Nope. And otherwise, are you, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, blood pressure, anything else? I do have diabetes, but that's about it, I think. And do you take anything for your diabetes? I take my form. Okay. Do you take any other medications at all? No. No, I don't. Do you have any allergies to any medications? No. Any environmental allergies? No, no, I don't. Okay. Have you been hospitalized in the past? No, no, no, haven't ever. I've been very, I've been healthy. No hospitalizations. Any past surgeries? I got my vicinity removed when I was a teenager. Okay. Have you been in contact with anyone who has been ill recently? No, I don't think so. Okay. And in terms of your family history, has anyone had any cancers or any IVD, like Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis? No, not that I know of. Anything that runs in the family at all? My dad had a heart attack. When he was in his 60s. That's it. Okay. And currently right now, do you work? No, I'm lead off because of COVID. Okay. And currently, what is your home situation like? What do you mean? So do you live in an apartment, a house, and do you live with anyone? I live in an apartment. I live alone. Okay. And in terms of your daily routine, you feel that you get an exercise, do you go outside the walks or runs, anything like that? I usually go out for a run, especially when it's a little bit warmer, which it now is. Yeah. And do you drink, also? Sometimes. Okay. How much would you say you drink in an average of three? I wanted to drink a day. Okay. And what do you usually drink? I'll just drink a glass of wine at night, which helps me relax. Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes? I don't. Okay. And do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana? No, I don't. Okay. All right. So that's all the questions I have. And just to clarify, does your pain come and go or is it constant? Yeah. So initially it would come and go. But now for the first two hours, it would come and go. And when I would have the pain when I was eating, it would come and go. But over the past six hours, it's just been...",

    "transcription": "what brings in here today? Yeah, yeah, last night. So having this pain in my right wrist, yeah, last night I tripped over something and I ended up landing on my hand to help break the fall. And this morning I woke up and I had some bruising on my hand and it's really sore to touch it. Okay, which hand is this? It's my right hand. Okay, and when you had your fall, when was your fall? So it was last night, probably like 10 pm, something like that. What out with a few friends for dinner and drinks? Okay, and do you remember how high you felt from or what you fell on to? Yeah, I was standing high. We were just kind of walking down the street and tripped over something on the curb. I think there was a like a poddle or something like that. And so I felt right onto the concrete with my hand. Okay, did you hit your head at all or lose consciousness? No, nothing like that. Okay, so it was mainly your hand that got injured. Yeah, it was mostly my hand. Okay, and are you having any pain on movement or if you press on it? Yeah, I do get some pain paying if I'm trying to move the wrist around and it hurts if you press on it as well. Okay, and do you notice any kind of swelling or bruising? I do, yes, they're swelling and bruising. Okay, and if you had to describe where the swelling and bruising and the pain are, how would you describe it? So I have a sharp pain right at my wrist, I feel it mostly at the base of my thumb kind of right at the wrist. And that's where the swelling and bruising is as well. Okay, and is it right under your palm or at the back of your hand on the wrist? At the back of the hand at the wrist and base of the thumb. Okay, okay. All right, and what kind of pain are you feeling is this sharp, is it dull, aching? Oh yeah, it's really sharp, it feels like sorry, it's stabbing me in the hand. Okay, and how much would you rate the pain on the scale of zero to 10, 10, being the worst pain you've felt in your life? If I'm not moving it around, it's a three, but if I move it, it goes up to like a nine on a 10. Oh, okay. And is it radiating or moving anywhere else on to your hand? No, I don't feel it anywhere else. Okay, and do you have any kind of pins and needles sensation, tingling or numbness anywhere in your hands? No, nothing like that. Okay, anything that makes the pain worse or better? Yeah, I tried some AT and flammatories, I did help with taking the edge off a little bit. But the pin just came right back and then also, like just moving it at all. It's even texting on my phone was really bugging me. Okay. Yeah, so you definitely, you went to, you had the fall yesterday or? Yeah, it was yesterday. Okay. Okay. All right. So when did it start hurting? Did it start hurting right away or has it gone worse at all? Yeah, it started hurting right away and it's, well, this morning it's a bit worse, yeah. Okay. Do you have any other symptoms at all? Like fever, chills, headache, anything like that? No. Any dizziness or feinting? No. Okay. Any diarrhea, constipation? No. Any changes in your vision, hearing, balance? No, nothing like that. Okay. But yeah, so your main concern today is this pain in your wrist? Yeah, exactly. Okay. All right. And do you have any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with? Yeah, I do. I have asthma and I use an orange inhaler. It gave me, and it's in well controlled. I'll use, I would use the blue one in a while. Okay, so it's pretty well controlled. Yeah. And do you take any other medications at all? I just did a multivitabin. Okay. And vitamin D as well. Okay. All right. And have you been hospitalized in the past or had any surgeries? Yeah, I have a ton of blood. If I was the teeth out when I was a teenager and, or tonsils when I was a kid, actually. And it's a second. Okay. Sun. Okay. Any complications at all with that at all? No, no. Every, every, that was okay. Okay. And have you injured your right hand or broken any bones before? No, I haven't. Okay. So this is the first injury on your right hand. Okay. And do you have any family history of any medical conditions at all? Yeah, my, my uncle died of a heart attack when he was at his 60s. I think my grandfather also had a heart attack as well. Yeah, that's what it is. Okay. And in terms of your work, do you do, do you work currently? Yeah, I do. I work in a restaurant. And so this will be difficult for my job coming up with an injured rest. I, and, and hand, I just restarted and I'll have to be carrying a lot of different things. And so I just hope it's not broken. Oh, I see. Yeah, it might definitely, and that might be concerning. You know, we'll get that track though on X-ray and everything. But we just need to do a few, few more questions and some examination as well. How would you describe your living situation right now? So I'm living, I'm actually in an apartment. Okay. And do you currently smoke? No, I've never smoked. I couldn't with having asthma. So I just did it away from home and that. Okay. And do you drink alcohol? Yeah, I do. I have a couple of bottles of wine per week. Okay. All right. A couple of bottles a week. So how much would you have in an average day? Oh, I guess probably like two or three glasses a one a day. Okay. Yeah. So we definitely recommend for women to limit themselves to maybe one to two max two glasses of one. And then we'll have wine a day as it can have health effects in the future in terms of drinking and then on your liver. Okay. And other than that, I just had a few questions. Any recreational drugs like marijuana? No, stay away from that as well. Okay. Okay. So I'm just going to ask a few questions about specifically to examine your rest. So you notice, so can you are you able to move your wrist around? Are you able to make a fist? I can, but I can't really bend my thumb. And it hurts a lot. So I can bend my fingers, but my thumb's kind of out. Okay. Do the joints in your thumb hurt at all? No. Okay. And any pain anywhere else like on your fingers or your elbow? No. Okay. And what movement would you say hurts the most? Um. Probably just moving the the wrist like flexing and extending the wrist. Okay. And where this following you said is at the base of the thumb, right? Yeah, exactly. At the base of the thumb on the on the back of the hand, there are some neck bruising and swelling there. Okay. Is it warm at all to touch? No, it doesn't feel warm. Okay. Um. Okay. And if you press on, uh, are you getting any, uh, bony pain in that area? Like if you put press on a bone? Yeah. Like I mean, if I, there's one spot that if I press down, um, it, it's like 10 of the 10 pain, it hurts really bad if I, uh, press at the base of my thumb there. Okay. All right. So those are all the questions I had for you today. Um, uh, we definitely need to, uh, since you're having, uh, pain on just puppy, puppy in the area, they're swelling, redness, and you did have a fall and you landed on your, um, you caught yourself with your hand. There is a common, uh, fracture that can happen in those circumstances, uh, um, to your wrist. And so we need to do an x-ray. And, um, we will see if you have a fracture or not, but we also need to, um, see if we need to get a cast for you or, uh, if, um, making an interior, um, injury with, um, a, a splint or, and then based on what we see in your physical examination, we'll determine how long you need to be in the cast or splint, um, and then, uh, walk off from there. Okay. That sounds good. Thank you.",

    "transcription": "I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in. Yeah, so like a couple months ago, I was in the office and they told me that I've asked not like I had it when I was a little kid and I thought I grew out of it. But apparently not or like it came back or something. So, um, yeah. So they just told me to come back today. I don't really have like any issues. Okay. So, um, what what brought on the appointment in the summertime or a couple of months ago? So like I have gym class at school and my teacher just always saw it. Like I should be able to run faster. Like I'm like a good athlete, but I just could go much faster. And then like saying, I can't really breathe when I'm running that fast. And then you know, my mom is like, you should probably go and she'll probably make an appointment. Okay. And when you're exercising or in gym class, do you get short of breath? Or do you find that you have difficulty breathing? Yeah, yeah. Like I try to run fast. Kind of can't breathe anymore. So I kind of stop or go slower. Okay. And how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away? Look if I stop doing like the thing I'm doing it. I don't know. Not very long. A couple of minutes. Okay. And does this happen in any other settings? Sometimes when it's really cold outside, I'll go out and like my chest feels tight and feel like I can't breathe. And kind of sucks. Like when girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow angels and stuff and I couldn't do it. Oh, and another time like I went to my friend's house and they had like a bunch of cat. I felt like that weasy sound and I thought like that time it took longer for the breathing to get easier that I had to leave. Okay. So you've noticed changes to your breathing sounds like you've had noisy breathing before? Yeah, mostly just with the cat. Okay. We don't have a cat at my house. So I didn't really think anything of it. And then I went to my friend's house who had a bunch of cats. And at that time I could actually hear it. No, okay. And have you had a cough? No, I don't think so. Okay. And were there anything, was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away? Like I have the inhaler that the doctor gave me last time. So, so yeah, like I've been using that in gym class now. Okay. How many days per week are you using that? Yeah. Well, I'm a little confused now because I, the one I'm supposed to use like every day a couple of times and then there was a different one that I thought it was only supposed to be used if the other one didn't work. But now the nurse just told me that I'm supposed to use them both. So I only got the one at the pharmacy. So I don't really, I don't really know. I feel like a bit confused now. But I always use the one, both to be like two times a day, so I'm sorry to the nap. But sometimes I just do it one today if I forget the second one. Okay. Well, we could definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today. Sometimes for steroid medications, those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximum benefit. And so we'll take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and how often you're needing it. Have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at night time? Oh, no. Mostly like gym pasta, like I said. Okay. And have you had any other associated symptoms? I don't think so. Like what do you mean? So anything like allergies, like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like eye tearing? When I was around the cat, yeah. But not the other time. Okay. And do you ever have any rashes on your skin or really itchy skin? When I was a kid, but not really now. Okay. And how about any nausea or vomiting? No. You're okay. Any infectious symptoms overall? Hey, I don't think so. Okay. Any urinary problems? Uh, like, no. Okay. Um, any bowel problems? I don't know. No, that's all good. Okay. And any fevers or chills? Uh, no. Okay. And then how about having any night sweats? What's that? Uh, so overnight when you're sleeping, you'd wake up with either your, like pajamas, drenched or your, your sheaths drenched, drenched from sweating? Oh, no. Okay. I'm not that. Okay. So I just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health. Have you been, so you mentioned asthma? Uh, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions? Uh, no, no, that's it. Okay. Um, and any recent hospitalizations? Hmm. Like, I broke my leg years ago, but like, that was just like really fast. Okay. Uh, any surgeries? Uh, just like my wisdom teeth. Okay. And, um, any medications? These side, like, including the, um, inhalers? Uh, nothing else. Just those things and my mom makes me take a vitamin. Okay. And any allergies? Uh, well, I don't know. I like not that I thought, but maybe like cash. Okay. And do you have any six, like, seasonal allergies? Do you find like, in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get some, uh, like dry eyes or really itchy eyes or runny nose? Uh, yeah, I was just not like I had a cold, but I guess like I usually feel like that in the spring time. Okay. Um, and, uh, are your immunizations up to date? Uh, I think so. Like I've had all the stuff that I'm, that I'm supposed to do, I think, I don't know the names of everything. Okay. And, uh, so actually, I just wanted to ask a few questions about, uh, personal and kind of lifestyle habits, but, uh, first I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation. Yeah, like I love with my mom and dad and, uh, my little brother. Uh, okay. Yeah. Okay. And, uh, where do you go to school? Um, to, to the school, not like high school down the road. Okay. And it will grade now. Um, I'm in grade 11. Okay. And, uh, what types of, um, uh, like hobbies or kind of activities are you interested in? Uh, like I like playing video games. Um, I was really wanting to, uh, join the Marines and I was really trying to get into that stuff. Yeah, but then I heard like you can't, when you have asthma. Uh, so I kind of want to know about that. Like is that going to stop me from doing that? Yeah. So it's something that, um, we'll, we'll look into today. I'm not too sure what the details are, uh, um, regarding that information, but thank you for bringing that up and we'll be, uh, for sure to look into that together. Um, and that reminded me of a question I wanted to ask earlier. Um, and so have you had pulmonary function tests, uh, done before? Uh, what is that? So, um, essentially they'll have you kind of breathing into a tube, um, where you'll have, uh, periods where you'll maximally inhale and then, uh, maximally exhale as quickly as you can. Uh, you'll do different, um, types of, uh, breathing, uh, movements so that it gets measured on a, on a device. Oh, like, is that like when you breathe in the tube? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, like the last time I was here, like, probably a month ago, I did that and he said that my asthma was back. Okay. Thank you for clarifying. Um, and so, uh, so for the last few questions about, um, uh, the personal habits I was wondering, I understand that people, um, in your age group, might experience with smoking or, or alcohol, do any of your friends do that? Uh, I mean, sometimes we'll drink beer like at parties on the weekend. I don't, I don't drink a lot. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about your death? Sorry, I missed that. Um, there's just one, I wonder, uh, can you tell me a little bit about your diet? Oh, uh, well, I'm always, um, like makes me, uh, a lunch, like I'll have like a sandwich for lunch. Like, you know, ham and cheese or something. We usually have like, cereal for breakfast. I'm all mixed in, and I usually like, meat and like, potatoes and vegetables or something. And I think it's like pretty normal. Okay. Um, and, uh, are you currently sexually active? Uh, uh, like I have a girlfriend, um, like just with her, uh, like this recently. Yeah, we started. Okay. And, um, do you use a condom? Yeah. Yeah. Every time or, um, sometimes. Oh, yeah, every time. It's nothing at many times, but yeah. Okay. Great. And, um, have you had any other partners? Oh, no, no, like I had made out with other people before, but this is like the first one. Okay. Have you had us actually transmitted infection before? Uh, no. Okay. And, um, I know this, uh, question might seem, um, a little bit invasive, but it's important to ask everybody. Um, have you had any thoughts of hurting or harming yourself? No. Okay. I have it. Okay. Great. Um, and, uh, in, in your family, has anybody ever had any of these similar symptoms before? Uh, like my, my dad, I think he maybe had us when he was younger, but like he doesn't really have it now. Okay. Uh, and any allergies that run in the family? Hmm. Like my, my dad also, my dad gets like a runny nose in the spring. So, yeah, I think that's allergies. Okay. Um, so overall, it's, it's sounding like, um, even having this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing episodes that you're saying that it's made worse when you're exercising out in the cold. And then around pets and sometimes when the season changes as well in the spring and so, and then, um, with a recent diagnosis on, pulmonary function tests a few months ago. Um, so I think it would be important to, uh, clear up the medications today and try to get that, um, better organized moving forward because it sounds like you're still pretty symptomatic, um, with needing to use them. Um, daily, currently. And so, uh, we'll look into that and then also the question about, uh, the marine, um, um, interest with, uh, asthma. Yeah. Thank you. I really want to know that. Like that was my plan and now I'm kind of worried I can do that. Excellent. Okay. Thank you.",

    "transcription": "tell me what brought you in today? Sure, so my son, he's two and a half months old, and we're in the ER because he's had this cough fever, seems like he's breathing too fast, it's been happening for the past two days and we weren't sure what else to do for him. Okay, so the first thing here would be like vital signs and assessing kind of stability. So is there... So we're going to save White. That information. We're going to save White. Stable, he is on to leaders of oxygen right now. Okay, so when did the symptoms, specifically start? Two days ago. Okay, and what started first? So I guess he was coughing first and then we took his temperature and it seemed like he had a fever, it was over 38 and then over the past couple of hours it seems like he's having a hard time breathing, he's breathing too fast. Okay, so with this cough, has there... has it been any sputum come up? Yes, yeah, yellow sputum. Yellow? Okay, any blood that you noticed in the sputum? No. Okay, and how was the fever checked? We did a rectal. Okay, and has the temperature... has there been a fever the entire time? We checked twice, we checked on the first day and then again last night. Okay, and in regards to the difficulties breathing, has there been any changes to... Is there been any noisy breathing? I would say he sounds slightly lazy. Okay, have you been hearing any whistling sounds when he's breathing in? I wouldn't say whistling, no, no. Okay, and has he been... experiencing any other symptoms? No, he actually... he hasn't gone through as many wet diapers as he normally does. Okay, has he been... well, how's his appetite been? Not the greatest, no. Okay, so not eating as much or drinking as much? Yeah. Okay, how has his behavior been? Oh, he's been very, very fuzzy. Okay, in-consolable, would you say? Yes, yeah. Okay, and any bowel problems? No, not that we noticed. Okay, and any vomiting? No. Okay, and have you guys been around anybody who's been sick? No. Okay, sorry, everybody else has been well. Any travel recently? We haven't traveled recently. My mom, so his grandma had traveled recently, and he saw her last week. Okay, where did she go? Mexico. Okay, and how's grandma doing now? She's doing fine, yeah. Okay, and he saw it. He spent some time with her? He spent a day with her. Okay, I see. And so in regards to past health, has he had any symptoms or like this before? I guess last month, he kind of had similar symptoms, and they said it was a viral infection. So he was just giving some puffers to help us breathing, and he got better on his own. Okay, did they tell you what the diagnosis was? At that time, we're just saying that it was a viral infection. No, they said it could be broncholitis or just an upper viral infection. Okay. Okay. Any reasons for hospitalizations? That time that he had the broncholitis or viral infection, he was hospitalized for two days just to help his breathing. Okay. And any medications that he takes regularly or uses regularly? Uh, he, no, no. Okay, any allergies to medications that you're aware of? No. Okay. And in regards to berthic or prenatal history, were there any complications throughout pregnancy? No, I wouldn't say so, no. It was normal. Everything was normal and he was a healthy baby. Okay. And has mom had any complications with any prior pregnancies? No, he's the first one. He's the first one. Okay. And was mom well throughout the pregnancy like no infectious symptoms during? No. No. Okay. Um, and any concerns with his growth or development so far? No, he's been normal. Okay. And then any concerns with either his vision or, uh, yet, or hearing? No. Okay. So if you, uh, um, okay. And, uh, and any, are his immunizations up to date? Uh, yes, they are. Well, okay. And could you tell me a little bit about the living situation? I, who's in the home currently and where you guys are living? Yeah. So we live in a house. It's him, uh, myself and my husband is dead. Okay. Um, any pets at home? No pets. No. Just walk like goldfish. Oh, cool. Um, and, um, are there any concerns for, uh, um, like, uh, verbal abuse in the home? No. How about any physical abuse in the home? No. Okay. Um, and does anybody, uh, spoke cigarettes in the home? No. Okay. And then how about, um, uh, drink alcohol? Hmm. We have like a glass of wine once a week. Okay. Um, and who's the, uh, primary, uh, care deal for him? Hmm. I guess, uh, we both are, um, yeah, we both are. Okay. Um, and, uh, in the family, are there any, uh, lung conditions like asthma or, um, any heart conditions that run in the family? Um, my sister, so has Aunt, has asthma. Okay. Um, and, uh, does anybody, um, is there any congenital diseases that run in the family? No. Okay. How about any genetic diseases? No. Okay. Um, and, um, so, um, it's sounding like, um, we wanted to do a, uh, a workup for, um, his symptoms right now for breathing heavily and, uh, with the fever that's concerning for, uh, a type of infection and with being under three months, um, it would warrant, uh, some, investigations. So we'd want to check, so do some blood tests, um, uh, and check, um, his cerebral spinal fluid as well to make sure that there's no infection. Um, and, and in the brain, I guess, and, um, we'll kind of go, go from there. Sure. Yeah. That sounds good. Okay. Um, in the meantime, yeah, we'll give you some, um, inhalers and keep the oxygen on to help, with the lungs, um, in the breathing and then keep, um, monitoring for, um, uh, how he's doing, uh, symptomatically. Okay. Thank you. Uh, you're welcome. Were there any, uh, was there anything else that I, uh, missed the task about? I know. I don't think so. Okay. Oh, that sounds good. So if there was nothing else that you wanted to share, um, we'll get that started and, um, um, I'll, I'll be back shortly. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.",

    "transcription": "Nice to meet you, what's your name? My name's Scott, it's nice to meet you too. All right, so Scott, how old are you? I'm 15. 15? OK, what brings you in today? I've had a sore throat now for a couple of weeks, and it's just not going away. Couple of weeks? OK, so about two weeks, three weeks? Yeah, about two to three weeks. OK. What does it feel like? Is it kind of like a burning feeling? Is it more like an itchy feeling? What does it feel like? I would say it's kind of, yeah, like burning or or scratchy. OK. And does it hurt when you swallow? It does, yeah. When my throat hurts when I'm eating or swallowing it, like liquid as well, but cold stuff seems to make it feel a little bit better. OK, good. And does your neck hurt too? A little tender. I've noticed the some lumps at the front of my neck that have been a bit sore. OK. And is it mostly sore kind of like midline or is it more sore to one side versus the other? Maybe the right side is a little bit more sore, but I can feel it on both sides of my neck. OK. And how bad would you say your discomfort is one to 10, 10 being the worst? I would say maybe a two or three. If I move my neck, I can feel it more, but otherwise it can just barely notice that it's there. OK. So it's not preventing you from sleeping, going to school, playing, things like that. No, it's more so the sore throat when swallowing. OK. OK. Have you noticed a fever at all? I have. Yeah, I felt hot and I checked my temperature this morning and it was 38.7. I think it was. Is that a fever? Yeah, I'd say that's a fever. We can also do another temperature check today. OK. Yeah, but that definitely sounds like a fever. Have you noticed rashes anywhere? Yeah, I've had this red, I guess, pink rash that I have noticed. It's come over my chest and belly area. OK. How big is it? Is it more than a centimeter? Uh-huh. Yeah, it's pretty well. I mean, it's kind of spread out over an area. It's not all continuous, I guess. You can kind of see patches or blockages. OK. And is it raised? No, it's not raised. OK. OK. Is it itchy? No, it's not itchy. OK. Painful? No, not painful. OK. And is it bleeding or oozing anything like pus? No, it's not. Nothing like that. It's just pink and red and it's just kind of showed up over the last little while. I've noticed it on my hands a little bit, too. OK. And you said the started when? Like was this before the sore throat or after? I can't remember the onset. I think the sore throat started first and the rash came a little bit later. OK. OK. And have you noticed that your glands are swollen? I think so. Maybe that's what's swollen in my neck. OK. OK. How about coughing? No, I haven't had a cough. No. And how about a stepy nose or a runny nose? Nothing like that. OK. Body aches. Yeah, it felt some muscle aches, for sure. OK. Upper limbs or lower limbs? I'd say a kind of whole body. I just feel like my muscles and joints are sore. OK. Yeah. And are do you have any headaches? No, I haven't really had any headaches. No, OK. And how's your appetite? Are you still eating well? It might be a little bit down. I just haven't been feeling so great. So I'm probably eating less the last few weeks. Yeah. Have you been around anyone who may have been sick recently? Yeah, actually, I think a few of my friends, or there was somebody in my gym class who decided they had similar symptoms. OK. OK. And when was this? Now I think about it. Probably about three or four weeks ago. OK. And were they ever treated for that? Did they see a doctor? I'm not sure. No. OK. No worries. I just remember them being off for school because they were sick. OK. Yeah. Any issues with your eyes? No. No. Nothing like crusting or pus coming out of your eyes, red eye, anything like that. No. No, they have looked to me a little bit more red than usual, but I haven't noticed anything in terms of itching is or discharge. OK. Any nausea or vomiting? No, no, no nausea or vomiting. OK. How about your stool? Have they been normal? Have you had diarrhea, constipation, anything like that? Those no changes to your bowel habits. OK. How about urine? That's been OK. OK. OK. Have you ever had these symptoms before? I mean, I've had sore throats in the past, but not while feeling like this, though. Yeah. OK. When was the last time you had a sore throat? I don't know. Maybe when I was a kid. OK. It's been a while. Yeah. Like a strep throat kind of thing, more or more viral. Yeah. I do remember getting antibiotics when I was younger. OK. OK. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any medical conditions? I was diagnosed with asthma. OK. And are you on any medications for that? Yeah. So I just use Ventilin as needed, but otherwise. Oh, and then I take flow vent daily. So. OK. I think that's the one. There's a couple of inhalers that I take. OK. OK. And any other medications? Sometimes I'll take like reactin or some other type of allergy pill, but that's it. OK. What are you allergic to? Well, I would say mostly seasonal allergies. But yeah, seasonal allergies and dust, maybe. OK. And are you up to date with all your immunizations? Yeah. My mom makes me get the flu shot every year. OK. Good. And OK. Have you seen another doctor for the symptoms at all? Have you been worked up for that? Any blood work testing done for it already? No, I thought I would have felt better by now. And so I haven't seen anybody, but it's kind of just been going on now and not seeming to get better. So I want to come see somebody. Yeah, for sure. Have you tried anything for your symptoms, any medications, anything over the counter? Yeah, I've had some Tylenol. And I think what is it, Advil? And the devil is helped with some of the kind of aches and pains, but they've come right back. OK. Any family history of lung issues, heart issues? No, nothing like that. No. Yeah. OK, have what cancers? I think my grandfather had a pancreatic cancer. OK. OK. All right. So you live at home, correct? Yeah, I live with my parents and my younger sister. She's 12. She's 12. Is she healthy? Yeah, she is. OK. Good. And have you guys traveled recently? No, we've been at home. OK. OK. And do you smoke? No, I don't smoke. No. How about marijuana? I've tried it once or twice, but just those couple of times. Nothing that I do or use regularly. OK. And how about alcohol? No, no alcohol. No alcohol. OK. Are you sexually active? No, I'm not. No, OK. Is there a possibility that, or actually, sorry, I should repeat this, that have you kissed anyone recently? I guess I kind of have a girlfriend now that I started hanging out with about two months ago. OK. OK. And so I guess yes. OK. All right. Well, that's good. Um, I have, how she had any of these symptoms? Well, she wasn't feeling well for a while back, but I don't think it was this bad for her. OK. And she's better now? Yeah, she's better now. OK. All right. So you mentioned your loss actually active. If you were to be, make sure you use protection. And OK. So everything at home is OK then. No one's sick at home, you mentioned, right? Yeah, no one's sick at home. OK. And school is going OK? All right. Yeah, school's been going OK for the most part. It's been tough days. Last few weeks feeling like this, though. Yeah, for sure. And are you and your girlfriend in an exclusive relationship? I think so, yeah. OK. I asked because there's something called what you may be familiar with and it's called the Kissing Disease in medical terminology. It's called Mono as caused by a virus called EBV. So it could be that, though. We're covering all our bases. Oh, I've heard of Mono before. Yeah. OK. It's likely I could be up there in terms of what you have. So I think those were all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions for me? Anything you wanted to add? No, I think that's you cover everything. OK. All right. So we'll go off a few. We'll try to cover our bases and get you tested for Mono, which you'd have to do like a Mono spot test. And we can do a rapid test as well. This EV has something called Streptro. But yeah, we'll see what those results come back as and we'll go from there. Does that sound good? Yeah. No, that sounds good. OK. Thank you.",

    "transcription": "What brings you in here today? Um, yeah, I've just been feeling breathless and just getting worse. So I wanted to check it out. Okay, and when did you first start feeling breathless? About two months ago. Okay, and did it come on about like gradually through time or suddenly just happened? I guess gradually, yeah. Okay. And how often do you feel breathless? I'd say it's worse when I walk more than 50 meters. That's kind of the main trigger, just exertion. And were you able to walk normally more than 50 meters before two months? Yeah, three months ago I was fine. Okay. And do you have any other symptoms like cough or chest pain? Um, I have a cough sometimes, yeah. Okay, but nothing like a constant? No. Okay. Do you have any wet cough or any productive cough or you're producing like sputone or flam? Yeah, I guess I'd say I have this frothy sputum. Okay. And has your breathlessness, again, been getting any worse at all over the last two months? I would say so, yes. And you mentioned like exertion makes it worse, but anything else like going outside or exporter during chemicals that makes it worse? I know, I don't think so. Okay. And how about a positional change? Does lying flat at all make it worse? I would say so, yes. Yeah, I'm basically gassing for air when I lay down. Okay. And do you ever find yourself waking up at night in the middle of the night to catch your breath? No. No. Okay. And when do you feel the breathlessness the most is it more so during the day or at night? I guess it's worse at night because I'm laying down. Okay. And in terms of how many lights of stairs you can climb before you start feeling breathless, do you have a number? I'd say like three, four. Three or four steps? Okay. And was there anything new that happened in your life recently? Any new medical diagnosis recently or any travel that happened before you started having these symptoms? No, nothing like that. Okay. And prior to the two months have you ever had any similar experiences? Parts two months? No. No. Okay. And does anything make it better like any positional changes makes the breathlessness go away? I guess what I'm not laying down or when I'm laying down I try to add pillows, stack pillows so that it gets better. Okay. And are you having any other symptoms like so-through, runny nose, chest pain, busyness, anything like that? No. Okay. Have you recently traveled outside of the country? No. Have you recently had any surgeries? No, recent surgeries now. Okay. Any headache, nausea, or vomiting? No. Okay. Any fevers or chills or night sweats? No. Okay. Do you feel increasingly fatigue throughout the day? No. Yes, I'd say so, yeah. Okay. Any changes in your bowel movement at all? No. Okay. Any chest pain at all within the last two months? No, no chest pain. Okay. Any swelling in your legs, ankles, or in your hands and arms? There are some swelling. Okay. And where are you getting the swelling? Around my legs. Okay. And how, when did you first notice this? Around the same time, actually, two months ago. Okay. Have you noticed any kind of fevers at all? No. No. Okay. Have you been in contact with anyone that has been ill recently? No. No. Okay. And have you been coughing up any blood at all? No. Okay. Any weight loss? No. Any nights sweats or chills? No. Okay. Any apart from the breathlessness that's been laying down? Any other issues that's your sleep? No. Any changes in your appetite? No. Okay. Have you had any recent infections like a cold at all? No. Okay. Any exposure to tuberculosis in the past? Not that I know of. Okay. Any exposure to fumes or dust within your whole more work environment? No. Okay. Any animals or pets in the house? No. No. Okay. And in terms of your past medical history, has anyone told you that you have anything like COPD or any cardiovascular issues like high blood pressure, cholesterol? So, yeah. So, have high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol? Okay. And do you take any medications for this? Yep. So, I take aspirin, ramiprol, and cymbastatin. Okay. And have you ever had any chest pain or heart attack in the past? Yeah, actually, I had a heart attack four years ago. Okay. And do you remember what they did for your heart attack? Something like a stent or something. Okay. And since then, you have been on these medications? Yes. Okay. And after they managed your heart attack, have you ever had similar symptoms when you had your heart attack? No. No. Nothing like that. Okay. Do you have any allergies, training medications? No. Any environmental allergies? No. Okay. And have you previously had any surgeries in the past? I guess the stent. Just stent. And apart from that, have you had any other previous health hospitalizations? No. Okay. Any family history of any cancers or heart attacks? My father died of a heart attack when he was 60. Okay. And currently, do you work at all? I do. I work as a cashier. Okay. And has the shortness of breath been affecting your daily routine at whole more at work at all? Yeah. I would say so. It's been hard to make it to work and then standing around all day, or if I have to go help out with something and exert myself too much, I guess you're a breath. Okay. And at home, do you currently live with anyone or do you live by yourself? I live by myself. Okay. And do you live in an apartment or a house? I live in an apartment. Okay. And are there any exposures like dust or mold or has this in your in your home environment? No. Okay. And currently, do you smoke? Not right now. I used to smoke. I used to smoke 10 a day for like 40 years. Okay. And do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana? No. Okay. Any alcohol? No. Okay. And in terms of your daily routine, do you feel that you get three meals a day while balanced diet? I would say well balanced. I'm trying to eat healthier, but it doesn't always happen. Okay. And how about exercise? Do you find that your exercise levels or activity levels have gone down in the last two months? Yes. Okay. All right. Is there any other questions or concerns that you have or something that may have missed to ask you today? No. I don't think so. Okay. So based on what we talked about from your swelling as well as breathlessness while laying down in your past history of a heart attack and high cholesterol, it may be likely with the medications you're on as well as your history that you might be having what's called a congested heart failure. So we will need to do further investigations to determine if that is what it is and if we need to get you on something like like a laxics or a diuretic to get rid of some of the fluid that's building up in your body which may be caused by a heart failure. So we'll do some investigations and then go from there.",

    "transcription": "what brings you here today? Yeah, I have this paid in my test. Okay, and where is the paint exactly? It's just right over on the left side. Okay, and when did this paint start? It started just 30 minutes ago. Okay, and did it just come on randomly or were you doing something, or were you doing this? I was just showing the driveway and it came on. Okay, and has that been a pain being getting worse at all over the last month or half ago? No, it just came on suddenly and it's... Sorry, yeah, the paint has been there this whole time and it's gotten worse ever since it started. And how would you describe the paint as it kind of like an aching pain or as a sharp or tightness kind of pain? How would you describe it? It feels dull. I feel like there's a lot of pressure on my chest. And how do you rate the paint right now on a scale of 0 to 10 or being the least someone of pain you've felt in your life, 10 being the worst? 7. Okay, have you had any similar episodes before? No, I've never had any chest pain before. Okay, and is the paint just staying in the region, the left chest area that you mentioned or is it traveling to any other part of your body? No, I'm kind of just feeling it right here on the left side. Okay, is there anything that you do that makes the paint either get worse or go away or get better? I think it's a bit worse if I'm moving around or when I was walking in here, I think it made it a bit worse, but do I think it seemed to make you any better since it's starting? Okay, and does it change it all from the changing positions like if you're standing up versus sitting down or laying down? I think it's a little bit worse when I'm laying down. And other than the pain that you've been having, have you been having any other symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing or any pain when you're breathing in or out? I've felt a little bit short of breath or having difficulty breathing since yesterday, when the pain started, but just the difficulty breathing. Okay, and have you recently injured your chest or surrounding area at all like from fall or anything like that? I do play rugby and was tackled by another player yesterday, but my chest felt fine after that. Okay, so but the pain just started hopping around. Yeah. Have you been traveling at all recently? No, but at home. Has anyone around you been sick at all? No. Have you been having any symptoms like nausea or vomiting or any fever or chills? No, nausea or vomiting, but I do feel a little bit hot today. Okay, have you measured your temperature at all? I did and it was 38 degrees. And have you been having any kind of swelling in your legs or feet? No swelling in my legs. Have you been feeling tired at all like increasingly fatigued? No, my energy has been good. Have you been having any kind of thumping or palpitation or feel like your heart healthy racing at all? It does feel like it's beating faster right now. Usually it only feels like this when I'm playing sports. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your skin at all? Any rashes? No rashes. Have you had any cough or runny nose or sore throat? Any kind of those symptoms in the past month? No, two weeks ago. I might have known this was all of the runny, but that went away on its own. I haven't had any cough. Okay. And have you been feeling dizzy at all or have you fainted? No, dizziness and no, I haven't fainted at all. I have a few more questions. Have you had any diagnosis made by any physician or anything like diabetes or high blood pressure? Yeah, I've been told I have high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Okay. And do you take any medications for these things? Do you take medications for both blood pressure and cholesterol? Resurve a satin and Lucidiprol. And I take a multivitamin. And do you have any allergies to any medications at all? No allergies. Have you at all in the past been hospitalized for any reason? No hospitalizations. Any previous surgeries? No. Okay. And within your family has anyone that passed away from a heart attack or in cancer, is that one in the family? No. Yeah. Okay. And currently right now, do you live alone? Do you live with someone and where do you live with? Like a apartment house? I live in a house with my parents. Okay. And do you currently work? Yeah, I drive a bus for the city. Okay. And in your daily routine, would you say you get enough exercise throughout the week? Yeah, usually on Sundays I'll go for a run. Okay. And how about your diet? How's your diet? Like just regularly? Usually I feel like it's fairly balanced overall. I might eat out a little bit too often, but try to eat as many vegetables as I can. Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes at all? I do, yes. I've been smoking for the last 20 years, roughly. Okay. How much do you smoke on an average day? But a half a pack to a pack a day. Okay. And do you drink? No alcohol. Okay. And any recreational drugs like marijuana? No marijuana. But I have used crystal meth in the past. Okay. And when was the last time that you used crystal meth? Six days ago. Six days ago? Okay. And how often do you use crystal meth? I would say a couple of times a month. A couple of times a month? Okay. All right. And for how long have you been using crystal meth? For the last seven years. Seven years? Okay. All right. Thank you.",

    "transcription": "nice to meet you. What's your name? It's nice to meet you as well. My name is Jim and I'm here with my son, Joey here who he's had a sore throat now for the last couple of days. Okay. How old is he? Joey? He is three years old. He's three years old. Okay. And you said for the past couple of days, about two, three days? Yeah, probably. Yeah, about three days ago. He didn't go to school for the last two days because, or I mean, daycare, I should say, because the pain but was bugging him so bad. Okay. Yeah. So how long has he been going to daycare for? He started this year so he's been going for about six months. Okay. Is he having issues, swallowing food? Does it hurt when he swallows food? Yeah, he's definitely the last couple of days hasn't been eating as much, like solid food. He's drinking cold liquids. Okay. He says it's hurt to say it hurts the swallow as well. Okay. And does he ever question to his neck? Like his neck hurts? No, he hasn't said anything like that. Any methods about his neck? Okay. Have you ever asked him to eat his neck? Have you taken his temperature at all? Yeah, we did. And it's pretty high actually. It was like 39.4. Okay. Wow. Yeah. That's pretty high. Have you noticed any swollen areas on his neck? No. I haven't noticed anything on his neck. Okay. Any rashes that you've noticed? No rashes. No. Okay. And has he been having chills or night sweats? Nothing like that. There we've noticed. No shaking or sweaty bed. Okay. And how about like that stuff he knows or runny nose? No, nothing like that. Okay. And coughing? No cough. So is he complaining of any body aches? No, it's mostly just been his throat that he's complaining about. Okay. How about headaches? He hasn't mentioned anything with his head. And has he been around anyone who's been sick maybe at his daycare? I mean, his sister has had some colds. She's also in his daycare. So, I mean, maybe her? Okay. How old is she? She's two. Okay. So she's younger. Yeah. Okay. Any nausea or vomiting? No vomiting. Okay. How about diarrhea, constipation? How would you notice anything like that? His valvements have been normal? How about urinating? Has that been normal? His usual amount as far as I know. Okay. Any issues with his eyes, any, like, pus or bleeding or redness? No, his eyes have looked normal to me. Okay. How about his ears? Those have also been normal. Okay. Any sores on his mouth or inside? No, it does kind of look like they're, like it's pretty red in the back of his throat when I was able to look. But, uh, yeah. Okay. And has he ever experienced any of these symptoms before? He's had sore throats before, but I think this one is a bit more severe. He hasn't complained this bad before. Okay. Okay. Has he tried anything for it? Have you given him any over the counter medications? Yeah, we did use some Tylenol and it brought the fever down. So, that was part of the reason why we didn't come to end because he's had sore throats before, but, uh, the fever bounced back and, and the pain seems to, um, have continued. So, uh, we came in. Okay. Um, and does he, is he otherwise healthy? Does he have any medical conditions? Uh, yeah. He's otherwise healthy. No medical conditions. Hasn't been how to reason to see a doctor before? No. Okay. And then just, uh, how was your pregnancy with him? Was it normal? Any complications? Uh, yeah. So, I had, uh, gestational diabetes, but it was treated, it was treated with diet. And blood sugars have been fine now. But no complications to the pregnancy from that regard as far as I know. Okay. Any alcohol or recreational drugs used during the pregnancy? No, nothing like that. No smoking either. Okay. Okay. Good. Um, and how, uh, far along were you when, when you, uh, delivered him? It was a vaginal delivery just after 38 weeks. Okay. So, he was full term. Um, and you said vaginal delivery. Did they have to induce you at all? Uh, no. Okay. And was he a normal birth weight? Yeah. He was. Yeah. I think he was, um, like just over three kilograms. Okay. Good. And was he healthy after birth? Did he have any breathing issues? Uh, John does anything like that? Uh, no breathing issues or, or, or John does. Um, came home with us, uh, right away. Okay. Okay. And then, um, after that point now, um, has he been normal in terms of this, uh, weight, height, head circumference? Yeah. Yeah. He's been growing normally and, um, eating well, um, up to this point. Okay. And I should ask, um, has he been hitting all his milestones? Like is he doing the things that his peers are doing? Yeah. I would say he's keeping up with his, his peers in daycare and, uh, no, no concerns with his development. Okay. Good. Is he on any medications? No medications. No. Okay. And is he up to date with all his immunizations? He is. Yes. Okay. And, um, any allergies? Um, got that we're aware of. Okay. Any family history of lung conditions? Um, no, no family industry, prevent any lung conditions. Okay. And, uh, so who does, who does he love with at home? So, um, you know, my, uh, myself, um, and, uh, his father and then sister. So there's just the four of us at home. Okay. And, uh, what's the relationship like between all of you? Is there any, uh, domestic issues, um, or, are things okay? Oh, things are, are great at home. Okay. Is there at least supportive environment? Okay. Good. And does anyone smoke at home? No one smokes at home. No. Okay. Um, any carpets at home? Old carpets? I think there's a few area rugs around, but most of the carpets are gone. Okay. Okay. All right. So it sounds like from what you're telling me, he... Oh, sorry, I should have asked you this earlier. Has he had any issues breathing? No problem. No problem breathing, but his voice does sound a bit... a little bit off, a bit husky. A bit husky? Okay. All right. And nothing like a seizure, like a febrile seizure, right? No. I haven't seen any like limb jerking or anything like that. Okay. So just roughly doing... from the sounds of it, it sounds like he has a serthroat that's been persistent. And we do this thing called a centorscore. So it sounds like he's had a fever, no cough, sore throat. So the first thing that we'd want to check to see or to rule out would be a strep throat. And then, well, if that comes back negative, we'll go from there and think about other viral causes for a strep throat as well. Did you have any questions or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today? No, we were thinking that it could be maybe strep throat. So yeah, thank you. Okay, great. Thank you.",

    "transcription": "That will bring you to clinic today. Hi, so I feel like I might have a bladder infection. I see a urologist because I've had some issues with like an overactive bladder for a while. I've had to see bladder infections in the past and this is usually how they feel. You guys feel like a little bit of burning when I go to the bathroom and I have to go like a lot right now. But then also sometimes it means that like it gets like this when I have my period and I don't have my period right now, but I, you know, I could be getting it, but I also just don't want to let it go. Keep going if I do have an infection. I just like, how they get it treated if I do. Okay, understood. When was your last period? Like two weeks ago? About two weeks ago. Are you fairly regular? Like yes and no. I'm not super irregular, but I sometimes have like basically it's like I alternate sometimes I, my cycle's like four weeks and sometimes it's more like five. Sorry, let's clarify. I get your third year's old. Yeah, I'm 30. Okay, are you only your contraception right now? No, I'm not. Okay, are you sexually active at all? No. No. Okay. So just in terms of your, you're in a retractive sections, what was your last one? I had one like three months ago, maybe three months ago. Okay. And they prescribed you antibiotics and it went away really quickly. Yeah, yeah, I went away. Like I always, I always have a no-vractive bladder and I always have to go pretty frequently like every hour sometimes half hour, but that's still there. But it's like it hasn't, it's been I haven't had any like pain. Okay, so you still have quite a, you have a, quite a bit of urgency to go. Kind of keep going more frequently, but I suppose the new thing they are a little bit concerned about is that it burns a little bit, stays a little bit when you do your knee. Am I understanding correctly? Exactly. Like for the past couple of days, it's about like that. Okay. Has it been getting progressively worse at all? Maybe a little bit. I feel like now I can recognize it pretty early when it's not too bad to kind of get ahead of it. Okay, understood. And do you have any pain kind of behind your ribs at all? When you're back. So I can repeat that. You haven't had any pain on your back, middle back kind of close to your ribs, have you? Not that I can think of. Okay. And have you noticed any changes to the quality of the year? For example, is it frothy or smelled bad? It maybe looks like a little cloudy. Nothing else out of the ordinary. Like I've never had blood in it or anything. Understood. Have you noticed any visual changes in the area here for Jaina? No, not that I can't see anything like that. Anything concerned for an STI that you're worried about? No. And like I haven't had a sexual partner in a few years. I'm understood. Understood. Is it kind of questions that we ask when someone's having a little bit of maybe an issue holding in their ear? But you are felt any numbness or inability to feel kind of around your buttocks region. For example, when you wipe with tissue paper, can you feel that well? Oh, yeah, I can feel everything. Okay. And no changes to your poops, to your balance. No. Well, it's pretty normal. Okay. And how do you feel otherwise? I mean, I feel a little tired. I felt like a little hot yesterday. I don't have a thermometer. I didn't take my temperature. But sometimes I feel a little hot like when I've had the infections before. Okay. You don't have me swelling on your body or your ankles, do you? No. I'm not. Anywhere on your body or your ankles, do you? No. No. Okay. And then so no puffiness around your eyes that you've noticed? No. I can't believe that. Any rashes or any changes on your face? Like my mom said, I saw my mom earlier and she said I looked like a little flushed. But it's not like a rash or anything. No. No markings across the bridge of your nose and your cheeks. No. Okay. And then in regards otherwise you feel a little flushed or tired. Any other medical issues that you have? No, just this like overactive bladder thing. Okay. And have they given you any medications for it? We tried a few different ones before. And now I get I get Botox injections into the bladder like maybe twice a year. Anything else they've used recently? Like any medications you're on right now, I suppose? No, nothing. No, nothing else. I guess I have like I have an inhaler, but I don't use it all the time. Like I haven't had it here in a while. So you have asthma? Yeah, like I honestly don't feel like I have it very much now, but I still have like I still have. Understood, understood. Anything else you've taken medications for in the past? Oh, I used to take birth control like the pill, but like I just I don't have the right now. And then it didn't really feel like I needed it otherwise. Understood, understood. And have you had any past surgeries? Um, I had my handiczo when I was 24. And that's it though. Okay, got it. And then just in terms of you yourself, do you live in London? Yeah, yeah, I do. Okay. Oh, what do you do for work? I work at a bank. Do you have any children? No. Okay. And in regards to anything, so any sick contacts? Uh, no. Any recent travel? No. Any allergies? Uh, like sometimes in this ring, I'll get like a little stuffy. Okay, so it's good. I feel like a lot of things are going to be like, yeah. Nothing too concerned. No drug allergies. No, nothing like that. I got it. Okay, I think what now doing next, I'll move to a physical exam. I think we might just do some investigations just in order to get some more information. And then the physician will come into see you. Okay. Well, thank you.",

    "transcription": "how may I help you? Hi, I'm Yasup. How does pain in my left elbow for a couple of weeks now? And it's not getting any better. So I'm just here to kind of figure out what it is. Okay. All right. Are you feeling this pain on the lateral side of the elbow on the, or on the medial side of the elbow? It's on the medial side. Okay. And sorry, when did this pain exactly start? So it's been ongoing for like the past three months, but it's gotten worse over the last, I'd say, three weeks. Okay. And has the pain been getting worse? Any better? The pain's been getting worse. Yeah. Okay. Was there any triggers or precipitating events to the pain, such as like a fall or any types of trauma to the elbow? No, no, no, not that I can think of. Have you had any pain or injury to the elbow in the past? No. Could you describe the character of the pain? Is it sharp, achy or dull? It's usually achy, but it can be sharp. Okay. Does the pain radiate anywhere? No, it's pretty, it's pretty much in that one area. Okay. Just on the medial side of the left elbow. Yeah. Okay. And is there anything that you've done to help make the pain go away or any alleviating factors? I've taken some NSAIDs and that helps with the pain temporarily. Okay. And are there any factors that make the pain worse? When I, I guess when I like extend my elbow out, it gets worse. Okay. So with some movement, okay, in straightening the elbow. Yeah. Okay. And what is the severity of the pain on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt? I said about five. Okay. And so did you have any other symptoms associated with the elbow pain? No, not really. Otherwise, pretty healthy. Okay. So have you had any fevers or chills? No. Have you had any night sweats? No. Any any weight loss? No. Okay. Have you had any, any headaches? No. Any sensory changes like changes to your vision or hearing or even your smell or taste? No. Okay. Have you had any eye redness or eye discharge or your, your pain? No. Okay. Have you had a runny nose or a sore throat? No. Have you had a cough or shortness of breath? No. Have you had any weezing?

No. Have you had any abdominal pain? No. Any diarrhea or constipation? No. Have you had any urinary problems? No. Okay. Have you had any skin rashes? No. Okay. Have you had any numbness or tingling? No. And how about any muscle weakness? No. Okay. And any joint pains anywhere else? No. Okay. And any changes to your memory or, or any confusion? No. Okay. And have you had any fatigue? No. Okay. And I'll say, have you had any changes to your appetite? No. Okay. And have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past? No. Okay. So do you take any medications either prescribed or over the counter? No. I just take some multivitamins. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications? No. No. Okay. And have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries? I had a fracture when I was younger. It was in my humorous bone on the right side. Okay. So it's the, so the fracture was on the other arm? Yes. Okay. And did that heal? Okay. Yes. All right. So can you tell me about your living situation currently? Like whereabouts and who you're living with? Live with my partner of five years. We live in an apartment together. Okay. And are you working currently? I am. And what do you do? I work on the assembly line for Chrysler. Okay. And do you do repetitive tasks at work? I do. Okay. And do you notice this pain after more so after a shift or after, after a long day? Yes. Definitely. Okay. And what types of hobbies do you have? Like do you play golf or tennis or any kind of like sports, I guess? Yeah. I used to play golf before this pain in my arm and my elbow. So I haven't played it in the past six months. Okay. Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes? I don't. And do you drink alcohol? I'll have a glass of wine every other day. Okay. How about the use of any recreational drugs like cannabis or anything else? I'll smoke a joint once a week. Okay. Okay. And is there any family history of any hard or lung problems? No. Any musculoskeletal or neurological diseases? I know. Okay. I would any autoimmune diseases like thyroid disease or diabetes? No. Okay. And so actually I just wanted to walk through a physical exam. So when you look at the elbow yourself, do you see any swelling or redness? No. Okay. Does it look like there is any muscle atrophy, either in the forearm or the biceps or triceps? No. Okay. And how about any misalignment or joint deformity? No, I don't see any of that. Okay. And are there any scars? No. Okay. And when you press on the medial part of the elbow, do you feel pain? I do. How about over the electron or the, yeah, any pain over the electron on? A little bit. Okay. And is there any pain over the lateral part of the elbow? No. Okay. And any pain over the forearm or biceps or triceps musculoskeletal? No. Okay. And does the joint feel like it's hot? No. Okay. And any pain with shoulder or elbow movements? No. Actually, sorry, with the elbow, when I straighten it out all the way, it hurts a little bit. Okay. When you straighten it out all the way. Okay. But no pain with shoulder movements and full range of motion? No. No pain with shoulder. Okay. And how about pain with pronation and supination? With pronation, it hurts. Okay. I have the medial side. Yes. Okay. And how about with wrist? So with resisted. Yeah, wrist flexion. wrist flexion? Yeah, that hurts too. Okay. And then how about if you passively extend your your wrist as far down as as you can go? Down. Yes, that hurts too. Okay. And is there any numbness or tingling anywhere? No, no, no, no, no, numbness or tingling. Okay. Okay. So that was everything that I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention? No, that was it. What do you think I have and how can I fix it? Yeah, so it certainly it sounds like with the media aspect of your elbow having pain there last several months. And so the physical exam maneuverer such as like passive wrist extension, resisted wrist flexion as well as pronation and the point tenderness over the medial elbow. Here's could be a medial epicon delitis or a tendon opathy in that area. And so this is typically treated with activity modification. So this could be trying to avoid repetitive movements that cause pain and using medications such as anvil and Tylenol and doing strengthening and stretching exercises, which you can learn from physiotherapists or on your own as well. And also other things that the medial side of the elbow that it could be is an ulnar ligament injury or yeah, or the other thing we're considering is an ulnar ligament injury. And so if the pain isn't going away, then we might consider an ultrasound or something to look at the structures there. Okay, that sounds great. Thank you.",

    "transcription": "And it sounds like you're experiencing some testing. Yeah, so this chest pain has just been coming on for the last couple of weeks now. Okay. So two weeks. And can you tell me kind of where you're feeling that pain? Yeah, I'm just feeling this chest is comfort sort of over on the left side. Left side. Okay. Does this stay just in one spot or does it kind of spread anywhere else? No, I don't really feel it anywhere else. Yeah, I just feel it in that one spot on the left side. Okay. Does it feel dull and achy or does it feel more sharp? It feels pretty sharp. And is it constant like on all the time or do you feel like it kind of comes and goes? It comes and goes. I would say it might last for 20, 30 minutes at a time and then it goes away. Okay. And over the last two weeks since you said it started, has it gotten any worst? No, it's been about the same. Okay. And has it gotten more frequent? It's like 20 to 30 minute episodes. No, it happens about two or three times. I have two weeks. And if you were to rate it on a scale of zero to ten, zero being no pain and 10 being like the worst thing you've ever felt, where would it fall? I would say a four to ten. If you think of anything that you've done differently recently that could have brought it on, or is there any kind of common factor between the times that you've had to pay? I don't know. I separated from my husband two years ago, which has been really stressful, but other than that, I mean, I can't really think of any changes to my health or anything like that recently. Okay. You feel like you have been more stressed out in general? Yeah. The last couple of years has been a lot more stressful because of the those issues in my personal life. I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad that you're coming in and we can hopefully get to the bottom of this. Not that I think that's necessarily the source of your pain. You definitely want to look into everything, but it has really helped open to know that. When you've had these episodes, have you taken anything to help with the pain or done anything that you felt has made it go away? I've tried some Advil, some Tylenol, and actually, some Tums as well, and it hasn't really helped. Do you think it's worse when you're moving around? If you're kind of doing more exercise or is it kind of just the same, not or what you're doing when you get to episode? It actually, I feel like it happens most of the time when I'm either at work or driving. Okay, and before this two-week period, have you ever had anything like this before? No, I haven't had anything like this happen before. Do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for? No, previously healthy. And just jumping back to these pain episodes, when you have them, do you experience anything else? Do you get any knowledge that are evolving? No. Do you have any difficulty breathing during these times? No, I haven't. Have you noticed any fevers? No fevers. Have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick recently? No, I haven't. And have you traveled anywhere? No, I've been home. Okay, so you have previously been healthy, nothing that you've been seeing your family doctor for on a regular basis. Do you take any medication? I do not. No medications. Just the Tylenol and Avril I tried for the pain. Do you have any allergies? No allergies. And is there any history of heart problems in your family? Yeah, my father had a heart attack when he was 60 just last year. And it's actually one of the reasons what concerns me about the chest pain that I was having. For sure, it always feels very concerning when you have these symptoms and you know people in your life that have had issues similar issues in the past. I don't know that this is related to that. I personally don't think so at this point, but we're definitely going to do everything to look into it and rule out something that would be scary like that. I'm going to ask you a few more questions about your life style in general. You smoked cigarettes? Yeah, I smoked about half a pack to a pack per day. I've been trying to quit and I was smoking one pack per day, but so it is down a little bit, but still something I'm trying to work on. Congratulations. That's really tough thing to do. Good for you. That's really exciting. Step in the right direction, right? Do you drink alcohol? I do, but I'll have maybe water or two glasses of wine on the weekends. Do you use any other symptoms? No. I know that you said you don't see your family doctor for anything regularly, but I just want to check a couple of specifics. Have you ever been told you have high blood pressure? No, I've never been told I've had high blood pressure. Have you ever been told you have high cholesterol? I haven't, but I've actually never been tested either. Do you exercise regularly? Yeah, I actually either do some running or cycling probably three or four days per week. I haven't had any chest pain or problems exercising. That's good to hear. Have you ever had problems with heartburn? I don't think so. No. Okay. So just to kind of summarize what we talked about. Over the last two weeks, you started having these 20 to 30 minute episodes of chest pain on the left side. It feels more sharp. Is that correct? Yeah. And it's kind of constant when it comes on. There's nothing really that makes it better or worse. It just kind of blows away on its own after half an hour. So it's kind of stayed the same over over the last two weeks. Haven't really gotten worse or better. It hasn't gone away either. Right. Yeah. And you have been, it sounds like experiencing some stress in your life that definitely can play into that as well. Okay. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about that I didn't ask you today? No, I think that's. Yeah, I think that's all that I wanted to talk about today. So what I'm going to do is bring all this information to your family doctor and we can come back together and talk to you about the next step. Awesome. Thank you. Thanks for coming in.",

    "transcription": "brings you in today. So I've just had this pain in my chest for just over a week now. And it's constantly to have trouble breathing. Okay. How old are you Jen? 52. 52. Okay. When did this pain start? You said a week back. Yeah, just about that. I think maybe eight days ago. Okay. And is it a constant pain? Is it always there? It is, but it's definitely worse that it's the breathing that's been bothering me a lot more when I take a deep breath. The pain's a lot worse. Okay. Okay. And when you do get that, get that pain, how long does it last? Um, I would say, um, I don't know, 15, 20 minutes. It's, um, it goes away over, over time. Okay. And the shortness of breath, do you have that at rest as well? Uh, no. If I, if I take a break or, um, sit down to rest, then I can usually, uh, catch my breath. But if, even if I'm doing a little bit of exertion, like, um, walking a few, a few blocks or, um, something like that, I'm finding it. I'm short of breath. Okay. Um, do you, did anything trigger this a week back? Any trauma to the chest area, anything like that? Uh, no, no one else has been sick. I, I had a cough, um, about a week ago, um, and so I thought it might be a chest infection, but I'm not feverish. So, uh, I'm not sure. Okay. The cough isn't still there. Yeah. It's, um, I still have a cough. Okay. And, uh, are you, uh, coughing up any blood? No, I have it. I haven't noticed any, any blood. Okay. How about sputum? Um, no sputum. No. Okay. And do you feel like you're wheezing? Uh, no wheezing. No wheezing. Okay. Um, the shortness of breath, one to ten, ten being, uh, the worst, uh, the most severe. How bad is your shortness of breath? I would say, um, when I'm exerting myself, it could get up to like a seven or an eight. Okay. And you mentioned how, how far can you walk before you need to rest? Uh, I would say maybe a hundred meters. Okay. Before I was, um, able to run, uh, work, I was running, um, a few days per week. So, um, okay. It's honestly not like to eat. Okay. Um, and the chest pain is it sharp? Is it dull? Crampy? What does it feel like? I say it's sharp. Okay. Have you ever experienced this before? No, nothing like, like, like this before at all. I have never had any, um, any problems like this before. Okay. And, um, has it changed, uh, since it started a week back or has, uh, have your symptoms been pretty much the same? They've been pretty much the, the same. Okay. Okay. Um, do you have anything like COPD? congestive heart failure, anything like that? No, I've never had any heart problems, um, uh, in the past. Um, I, I've been healthy up to this point. No, um, nothing I see a doctor regularly for. Okay. Okay. Um, you mentioned no fever, no chills, um, no night sweats, too, I guess? Uh, yeah, no night sweats. Okay. And how about weight loss, any weight loss? Um, no weight loss. No. Okay. Um, um, have you experienced any changes in your vision? Uh, yeah, no, my vision's been, um, been fine. Okay, hearing, hearing has been okay. Okay, how about smell? No changes in smell. No, um, I have you had a step, you know, is there a runny nose in the past week or so? Uh, no, it was just the, the dry cough. Okay, dry cough. Um, any changes in your skin, like, rashes, uh, no rashes. Okay. And, uh, you mentioned some chest pain, any palpitations, like you feel like your heart's racing? Uh, actually I did feel like that a little bit, um, uh, especially when I was moving up a little bit more. I felt like my heart was, was racing. Okay. Um, any calf pain? Um, yeah, my left, my left leg's actually a little bit sore. Okay, any swelling in the area? Um, uh, no, I don't, don't see any swelling there. Okay. No. Um, yeah, we'll see that they're swelling. Okay. Okay. Um, and you mentioned shirt, as some shortness of breath, um, on exertion. How about when you're laying down? Uh, not when I'm laying down. No. Okay. And not when you're okay, not when you're laying down. Okay. Um, all right. And in terms of like your stool, uh, so bowel movements and urination, like all of that's normal. Yeah, all of that's been normal. Okay. Any headaches? Uh, no headaches. No, no confusion. Um, no, no confusion. Okay. How about dizziness or fainting spells? Um, no fainting spells. Okay. Okay. And have you already received any sort of imaging or pulmonary function test or anything like that for this recently? Uh, no, I, I, I haven't. Okay. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any past medical history of any conditions really? Um, no, like I've been, um, previously healthy. Um, but I, I guess I did have a hysterectomy a few weeks ago. I know it was, I didn't bring it up before because it's just a day procedure, but, um, I was definitely spending a lot more time, um, relaxing at home after that, um, a few weeks ago. Okay. Okay. So you haven't been moving around as much, I guess, since the hysterectomy. Yeah, exactly. It's starting to, it was starting to get, the pain was starting to improve, but, um, it was keeping me, uh, on the couch a lot of days. Okay. Yeah. Um, are you on any medications? Um, no, I tried, I tried some Tylenol and an Advil for the pain throughout this week and it didn't really help much. But, uh, other than that, don't take any, any medications, nothing for blood pressure or anything like that. Okay. And sorry, what was the hysterectomy for? Um, I, I was having a lot of, um, bleeding. Okay. So were they thinking it was, um, like a cancer or something? I think it, it, um, it was from, uh, uh, fibroids. Oh, okay. Okay. And, um, so you mentioned on medications, any allergies? Um, no allergies to medications. No. And are you up to date with any, with all your immunizations? Um, and yeah, you are. Okay. Any family history of lung conditions? Uh, no lung conditions. Okay. How about heart? Yeah. It was my, my mom had a heart attack when she was, um, 56. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry to give that. Um, and any, uh, history of family history of something called pulmonary embolism or, uh, DVTs? Uh, no, I haven't heard of, uh, heard of pulmonary embolism before. Okay. So it's basically, um, blood clots in your lung. And then DVTs are deep vein thrombosis. So also blood clots, but in different parts of your body. Okay. Yeah. Anything like that that you know of? Uh, I have, I might have heard of something like that, um, happening in my mom, actually, I might have been related to her, uh, heart attack, but I'm not specifically sure. Okay. Sure. Um, and then do you smoke? Um, I, I spoke, uh, maybe about half a pack of cigarettes per day. I've, I've spoken, um, ever since I was a teenager, I've tried to quit, uh, multiple times. I, I was smoking about a pack per day before. So I have cut it down, but, uh, still something that I'm working on. Okay. Good. I'm glad you're trying to cut down. Um, we have resources available if you're interested in somewhat help. Um, and do you smoke, um, marijuana? Uh, no, I don't. Okay. Any, uh, use of other recreational drugs? Uh, no. No. Okay. And how about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol? Uh, maybe a glass of wine on the weekends, but, um, other than that, no. Okay. Um, and have you had any sick contacts recently? People around you. People you live with that work. I can't think of anybody who's been sick. No. Okay. Okay. And, and what do you do for work, Jen? Um, I work as an administrator at, uh, at a bank. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, and have you traveled anywhere recently? Uh, no, I, I can't remember the last vacation. Okay. All right. Um, so, those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have anything that you wanted to add anything that I hadn't touched on? Um, no, I think you covered, uh, everything. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. No worries. So I guess at this point, we would do a physical exam, just take a listen to your lungs and your chest, um, after that. So right now, uh, it sounds like it could be something vascular, you know, like a pulmonary embolism like we talked about. That's kind of high on my list of, uh, things to work up for. Um, but also we don't want to miss other things, uh, you know, like cancer, infection, um, autoimmune things that could affect your lungs. So we'll just do a work up for all of that. Um, how does that sound? Yeah, whatever, whatever you think, uh, we need to do. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you for your time. Yeah. Thanks.",

Maybe not quite too late. I don't like it around. Yeah. Maybe like nine days. And do you always have the sensation of nausea or is it related to a fun and go? I think it's like worse to have a feeling something really bad and worse in the morning. But I feel like it's always kind of there. I see. Okay. Have you had any vomiting? Yeah, like a lot of days. I'll throw off like one for twice. And this is all been over the past week, two weeks or so? Yeah. Okay. Any other symptoms that you have? Oh. No. Just... Well, I feel like I've had to pee a lot more. But I don't think that's related. I think maybe I've just been drinking a lot of water. So... Yeah. How often do you have to pee? I feel like every couple of hours right now. Okay. So we save every two hours, every hour, every five hours. Yeah. Probably every... Probably every like two, maybe every hour. I guess there are times in the day. So you wake up in the night? Did it pee? Like, it doesn't wake me up. It's like, I wake up because I hear something. And I'll be like, oh, I think I should try this good offer. Yeah. Do you feel like you have control over when you are going to Vachem? Is it difficult for you to have hold it in? Oh, I can control it. It's just like I can control it, right? You have your nervous frequency, but do you feel like... So you said that you can control it. You don't feel like you need to run to the bathroom or you'll be in your dance. No, I don't feel like that. Okay. Do you have anything when you're peeing? No. No, it's okay. All right. Do you feel like you've been more thirsty recently? I've been drinking more water. I think just because I was getting... I was like, sure enough. I just feel like I was a little dehydrated. Wow. I see. Okay. Have you... other than the nausea and the vomiting? Have you... I had any other stomach-related issues? Any belly pain or changes in your bowel movement? No. I think so. It's like a little crampy. I thought it maybe could be my period, but not on my period. When did you last have your period? Oh, let me think. Like six weeks ago? I guess that would be. I don't really like keep track. Okay. Do you know if you get your periods regularly or are your periods irregular? I think they're usually pretty regular, but I don't like... I don't calculate it because of the day. Sure, yeah. So maybe yeah. Is it normal for you to go with six weeks without a period? I'm thinking of it. I don't think so. All right. Okay. I'll just ask you a couple more questions about your symptoms. I know that you've been nauseous and have wanted a couple of times with the last two weeks. And you have had some cramps in your belly. Have you had any flu-like symptoms? Nothing like that. I don't think so. Any headaches? Any pevers? No. Muscle aches? I know. Okay. Have you had a cough at all? Oh, no. Okay. And have you noticed any blood in your stools? No. No. Okay. Have you... You haven't had any... Salpitations or chest pain or anything of that sort? No. All right. Can you tell me about your fast medical history and medical issues, medical conditions that you have? Nothing, really. Okay. Have you been taking any medications? No. I mean, I've been taking like... I've been chewing like those ginger things that are supposed to help with nausea, but they weren't really helpful. Oh, I see. Any allergies? Just like, Nicole, like, in jewelry, if I were not real jewelry, it would be easier to rash, but it's not food, it's really... I'm medication, but there's not anything. And a couple of questions about your social history. Who do you currently live at? Like, I just live with one real name. And do you currently smoke? No. All right. Do you... You don't smoke? Okay. Have you... Do you smoke alcohol? No. I very rarely say, oh, he's gonna headache. Okay. When was the last one that you had? Oh, you got like a month ago, probably. Okay. And you can do many illicit drugs? No. No. All right. Are you currently sexually active? Yes. This is my boyfriend. And do you use protection while having sex? Yes. We just use condoms. Like, I used to be on birth control, but it always made me feel like kind of sick. So, I don't think it's that anymore. I don't think so. I guess my dad has like high blood pressure. Yeah. That's... Let's see. Family history. Do you have any medical conditions that run your family? Um... Like, I don't think so. I guess my dad... My dad has like high blood pressure. Yeah. I don't think there's anything else. All right. All right. Well, thank you so much for spending time with me today. I think if I gathered all the information that I would have liked, I will go to my attending. We'll come back, maybe ask a couple more questions, and then share the plan with you. Okay. Thank you.

    "transcription": "Would you mind by starting with what brought you in today? Yeah, so I'm just coming in with my son. He's six years old and yeah, just over the last few days, he's not been himself and he's been having this stomach ache. So which started around like, I would say three days ago. And then he's also having a vomiting for the last two days. He's vomited in total six times over the last two days. And then yesterday, he also developed a fever as well. And I managed to measure it and it was 38.3 degrees Celsius. Okay, I see. So just so that I'm understanding the timeline. So he started to have abdominal pain about three days ago. I started with having vomiting and diarrhea two days ago. And you checked his temperatures at a fever as of yesterday. Yeah. Okay. And was there anything that that he ate that was different over over the last few days? No, we've been strictly home food during like a pandemic, like no real changes. Okay. And what's his behavior been like over these last couple of days? Yeah. So I first with the stomach pain, he was a bit just irritable and just not himself, but especially yesterday with the fever, just been very quiet and just kind of sleeping pretty much the whole day. Okay. I see. And could you describe the vomit? Yes, vomit. Like started two days ago. The first day it was just like duped up things that he had eaten. But yesterday it was it was mainly just like just yellowish material. I couldn't really tell if it was food or not. Okay. Have you noticed any bile or blood in the vomit? No, I didn't notice any blood. And I didn't notice any green material. It was mainly just like normal vomit, like yellowish color. Okay. I see. And has the what was the vomiting triggered by anything that you're aware of? Like eating or drinking? Yeah. Two days ago it was after lunch, when he first vomited. But after that, it's just kind of random. I see. Okay. And in regards to his diarrhea, has there been any any blood or any color changes? No, no, I didn't notice any blood at all. It's definitely just very watery. And he's had to go probably even just in the last day, probably around like six or seven times. Okay. And he's vomited how many times? So in total, I can count six times. Okay. And has he been complaining about any headaches? So no, not that I know. Okay. And how about any ear pain or eye pain? No, not that he's mentioned to me. Okay. Any eye redness? Nope. Okay. And has he had a runny nose? No, not really. Okay. And has he had a sore throat or any pain with swallowing? No. Okay. Has he had any loss of taste or loss of smell? No, that's not that he's mentioned to me though. Okay. And has he had a cough? No, not really. Okay. And how about any shortness of breath or weezing? No. Okay. And has he had any pain anywhere in any chest pain? No, he did point to his stomach like it seems like he was having with all the vomiting like he was having some stomach pain as well. Okay. Is there any specific location that that he's feeling the pain? It's hard to say. He was just pointing at the center of his belly. Like I don't know if it's like I tried pressing on it and feeling pain then I think it's just kind of all over his stomach. Okay. And as he had any urinary problems like painful, boyding or being more often. No, he's been okay. Have you noticed any rashes or skin changes? No, not really. Okay. And has he had any muscle aches or joint pains that he's mentioned? No, he hasn't mentioned anything like that. Okay. And he's had a fever as he had chills. Yeah. So that's what prompted me to take his temperature yesterday around the afternoon. Like we had to wrap him up in like more than two blankets and he was still feeling cold. So yeah, definitely he was having chills. Okay. And and and have there been any concerns with his growth and other weight or height? So he's been playing all of the charts pretty well. Like your concerns during his growth. Otherwise he's a very healthy child. Okay. So no medical diagnoses previously. No, nothing like that. Okay. And and is he meeting all developmental milestones? Okay. It got a gross motor, fine motor. I'm doing well at school. Yeah. I mean, he's, yeah, and then didn't have any issues with walking, running. It's pretty social with all his peers. He's doing well at school. No complaints. Okay. Excellent. And to no medical conditions, but has there been any reasons for being in the hospital before? No, not at all. We, yeah, we haven't really gone to the doctor with him after like all those vaccinations I get to do. So he's been good. Okay. Great. So I'm immunizations are up to date. Yeah, immunizations all up to date. Excellent. And does he have any allergies? And no, not anything that we know of yet. Okay. And just wanted to ask about his birth history. Were there any complications throughout pregnancy, either mom being safe or having any, any issues herself? And also it was a normal, vaginal delivery. No issues. He was born at 39 weeks. Didn't need to stay in the hospital at all. Yeah, it was a pretty smooth pregnancy compared to some of the other ones. Okay. No, that's, that's great. Do you remember that appgar score or his birth weight? I don't exactly remember his appgar scores. I think they were like just, just, they were normal. Like there was nothing concerning about that. And birth weight, I think he was probably around three, three kilograms. Okay, great. So, and yeah, healthy birth weight at term, it sounds like. And so healthy, does he take any medications regularly? No, no medications. Okay. And can you tell me about who he's living with currently and who's looking after him? Yeah, so he's living with myself, his mother and, and my husband. And he has two older siblings. One is a boy, seven years old and another one, like a 10 year old girl. Okay. And has anybody in the house been sick? No, no one has been sick recently. However, he does, they did let them go back into school at one point. So I don't know, I don't know. So that was his last week. So I don't know if he caught something from school. Okay, but nobody that you know that's had similar symptoms. No, no, okay. And maybe travel anywhere. No, we've been, we've been at home. Okay. And then, yeah, no recent changes to anything in the diet you've mentioned. No, that's the plan. Okay. And any concerns for safety in the home, whether the physical or, or verbal abuse? No, no concerns like that. Okay. Yeah, a question that we have to ask everybody. And is there any smoking in the home? No, no, we don't smoke. Okay. Great. And are there any pets? No, no pets. All right. And in the family, has there been anybody who's had any heart problems or any lung problems? We are getting the ten year old tested for just asthma. Okay. But nothing diagnosed yet. Okay. Anybody in the family have any congenital diseases or any genetic diseases? No, not that I know. Hello. Okay. Anybody in the family have a silly act disease or, or Crohn's disease? No, no, no history of any kind of novel diseases. Okay. So I think that's everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything that maybe I forgot to ask or, or that I missed it? What do you want to tell me? Yeah, no, it's also just like I was just reading up. Can it be like, I don't know if it can be COVID as well, if it can, you can do this as well. It is possible. It's especially with non-specific symptoms, COVID can cause a variety of different presentations and there for some people it can be more gastrointestinal issues like your son has with vomiting and diarrhea and belly pain, but it also could be another type of gastrointestinal virus itself or a viral illness like the common cold, which can also end up causing symptoms like this as well. So we will go ahead and do a COVID test today along with some other but work and maybe increase the hydration as well. How it sounds like he has lost a lot of fluid over these last couple of days. So we'll check electrolytes and go from there on the test results. All right, sounds good. Thank you so much.",

And is there any joint, you know, joint laxity or pain to like a valgus stress of the knee? Yeah. So when I press, when I do that, it hurts on the medial aspect but not the lateral aspect. Okay. And does it feel as though there's some, like, the joints opening more when you put the valgus stress? A little bit, yes. Okay. And is there any instability moving that tibia anteriorly if you're like, pull it outwards? No. And how about if you pull the tibia posteriorly, any instability? No. Okay. And is there full range of motion of the knee? Yes. And full range of motion of the hip and ankle? Yes. Okay. And then do you have any, like, numbness, tingling or muscle weakness? No. Okay. And any sensory changes to the skin? No. Okay. And reflexes aren't normal. Okay. So I think that was everything I wanted to ask and kind of go through on the physical exam. Did you have any other questions or anything that maybe I forgot to mention today? No, that was it. Just what can I do about my knee? Yeah. So right now it's sounding like this could be an MCL or a medial collateral ligament strain or injury. And so these types of injuries are usually treated conservatively, like with things like NSAIDS or anti-inflammatories to help the pain and swelling. If the pain, depending on how severe it is, it might be useful to use maybe crutches for a day or two to try to help let the pain subside and allow you to be able to do some physical therapy exercises, like strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. But typically injuries that are lower grade will heal within two weeks. And so if it's more severe, it could take a bit longer. And although it's most likely MCL injury that you're describing, it could be a medial meniscal injury as well, or possibly even a percitis at the medial aspect of the knee. But the treatment to start with would be the same and maybe we'll get a knee x-ray if things aren't improving. Okay, that sounds good. Thank you.",
