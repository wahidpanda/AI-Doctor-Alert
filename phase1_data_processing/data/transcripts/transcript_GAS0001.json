  "transcription": "Now what brings you in today? I've just been feeling very nauseous for... It feels like all the time right now. When did this start? It's been over a week. Maybe not quite too late. I don't like it around. Yeah. Maybe like nine days. And do you always have the sensation of nausea or is it related to a fun and go? I think it's like worse to have a feeling something really bad and worse in the morning. But I feel like it's always kind of there. I see. Okay. Have you had any vomiting? Yeah, like a lot of days. I'll throw off like one for twice. And this is all been over the past week, two weeks or so? Yeah. Okay. Any other symptoms that you have? Oh. No. Just... Well, I feel like I've had to pee a lot more. But I don't think that's related. I think maybe I've just been drinking a lot of water. So... Yeah. How often do you have to pee? I feel like every couple of hours right now. Okay. So we save every two hours, every hour, every five hours. Yeah. Probably every... Probably every like two, maybe every hour. I guess there are times in the day. So you wake up in the night? Did it pee? Like, it doesn't wake me up. It's like, I wake up because I hear something. And I'll be like, oh, I think I should try this good offer. Yeah. Do you feel like you have control over when you are going to Vachem? Is it difficult for you to have hold it in? Oh, I can control it. It's just like I can control it, right? You have your nervous frequency, but do you feel like... So you said that you can control it. You don't feel like you need to run to the bathroom or you'll be in your dance. No, I don't feel like that. Okay. Do you have anything when you're peeing? No. No, it's okay. All right. Do you feel like you've been more thirsty recently? I've been drinking more water. I think just because I was getting... I was like, sure enough. I just feel like I was a little dehydrated. Wow. I see. Okay. Have you... other than the nausea and the vomiting? Have you... I had any other stomach-related issues? Any belly pain or changes in your bowel movement? No. I think so. It's like a little crampy. I thought it maybe could be my period, but not on my period. When did you last have your period? Oh, let me think. Like six weeks ago? I guess that would be. I don't really like keep track. Okay. Do you know if you get your periods regularly or are your periods irregular? I think they're usually pretty regular, but I don't like... I don't calculate it because of the day. Sure, yeah. So maybe yeah. Is it normal for you to go with six weeks without a period? I'm thinking of it. I don't think so. All right. Okay. I'll just ask you a couple more questions about your symptoms. I know that you've been nauseous and have wanted a couple of times with the last two weeks. And you have had some cramps in your belly. Have you had any flu-like symptoms? Nothing like that. I don't think so. Any headaches? Any pevers? No. Muscle aches? I know. Okay. Have you had a cough at all? Oh, no. Okay. And have you noticed any blood in your stools? No. No. Okay. Have you... You haven't had any... Salpitations or chest pain or anything of that sort? No. All right. Can you tell me about your fast medical history and medical issues, medical conditions that you have? Nothing, really. Okay. Have you been taking any medications? No. I mean, I've been taking like... I've been chewing like those ginger things that are supposed to help with nausea, but they weren't really helpful. Oh, I see. Any allergies? Just like, Nicole, like, in jewelry, if I were not real jewelry, it would be easier to rash, but it's not food, it's really... I'm medication, but there's not anything. And a couple of questions about your social history. Who do you currently live at? Like, I just live with one real name. And do you currently smoke? No. All right. Do you... You don't smoke? Okay. Have you... Do you smoke alcohol? No. I very rarely say, oh, he's gonna headache. Okay. When was the last one that you had? Oh, you got like a month ago, probably. Okay. And you can do many illicit drugs? No. No. All right. Are you currently sexually active? Yes. This is my boyfriend. And do you use protection while having sex? Yes. We just use condoms. Like, I used to be on birth control, but it always made me feel like kind of sick. So, I don't think it's that anymore. I don't think so. I guess my dad has like high blood pressure. Yeah. That's... Let's see. Family history. Do you have any medical conditions that run your family? Um... Like, I don't think so. I guess my dad... My dad has like high blood pressure. Yeah. I don't think there's anything else. All right. All right. Well, thank you so much for spending time with me today. I think if I gathered all the information that I would have liked, I will go to my attending. We'll come back, maybe ask a couple more questions, and then share the plan with you. Okay. Thank you.
