  "transcription": "nice to meet you. What's your name? It's nice to meet you as well. My name is Jim and I'm here with my son, Joey here who he's had a sore throat now for the last couple of days. Okay. How old is he? Joey? He is three years old. He's three years old. Okay. And you said for the past couple of days, about two, three days? Yeah, probably. Yeah, about three days ago. He didn't go to school for the last two days because, or I mean, daycare, I should say, because the pain but was bugging him so bad. Okay. Yeah. So how long has he been going to daycare for? He started this year so he's been going for about six months. Okay. Is he having issues, swallowing food? Does it hurt when he swallows food? Yeah, he's definitely the last couple of days hasn't been eating as much, like solid food. He's drinking cold liquids. Okay. He says it's hurt to say it hurts the swallow as well. Okay. And does he ever question to his neck? Like his neck hurts? No, he hasn't said anything like that. Any methods about his neck? Okay. Have you ever asked him to eat his neck? Have you taken his temperature at all? Yeah, we did. And it's pretty high actually. It was like 39.4. Okay. Wow. Yeah. That's pretty high. Have you noticed any swollen areas on his neck? No. I haven't noticed anything on his neck. Okay. Any rashes that you've noticed? No rashes. No. Okay. And has he been having chills or night sweats? Nothing like that. There we've noticed. No shaking or sweaty bed. Okay. And how about like that stuff he knows or runny nose? No, nothing like that. Okay. And coughing? No cough. So is he complaining of any body aches? No, it's mostly just been his throat that he's complaining about. Okay. How about headaches? He hasn't mentioned anything with his head. And has he been around anyone who's been sick maybe at his daycare? I mean, his sister has had some colds. She's also in his daycare. So, I mean, maybe her? Okay. How old is she? She's two. Okay. So she's younger. Yeah. Okay. Any nausea or vomiting? No vomiting. Okay. How about diarrhea, constipation? How would you notice anything like that? His valvements have been normal? How about urinating? Has that been normal? His usual amount as far as I know. Okay. Any issues with his eyes, any, like, pus or bleeding or redness? No, his eyes have looked normal to me. Okay. How about his ears? Those have also been normal. Okay. Any sores on his mouth or inside? No, it does kind of look like they're, like it's pretty red in the back of his throat when I was able to look. But, uh, yeah. Okay. And has he ever experienced any of these symptoms before? He's had sore throats before, but I think this one is a bit more severe. He hasn't complained this bad before. Okay. Okay. Has he tried anything for it? Have you given him any over the counter medications? Yeah, we did use some Tylenol and it brought the fever down. So, that was part of the reason why we didn't come to end because he's had sore throats before, but, uh, the fever bounced back and, and the pain seems to, um, have continued. So, uh, we came in. Okay. Um, and does he, is he otherwise healthy? Does he have any medical conditions? Uh, yeah. He's otherwise healthy. No medical conditions. Hasn't been how to reason to see a doctor before? No. Okay. And then just, uh, how was your pregnancy with him? Was it normal? Any complications? Uh, yeah. So, I had, uh, gestational diabetes, but it was treated, it was treated with diet. And blood sugars have been fine now. But no complications to the pregnancy from that regard as far as I know. Okay. Any alcohol or recreational drugs used during the pregnancy? No, nothing like that. No smoking either. Okay. Okay. Good. Um, and how, uh, far along were you when, when you, uh, delivered him? It was a vaginal delivery just after 38 weeks. Okay. So, he was full term. Um, and you said vaginal delivery. Did they have to induce you at all? Uh, no. Okay. And was he a normal birth weight? Yeah. He was. Yeah. I think he was, um, like just over three kilograms. Okay. Good. And was he healthy after birth? Did he have any breathing issues? Uh, John does anything like that? Uh, no breathing issues or, or, or John does. Um, came home with us, uh, right away. Okay. Okay. And then, um, after that point now, um, has he been normal in terms of this, uh, weight, height, head circumference? Yeah. Yeah. He's been growing normally and, um, eating well, um, up to this point. Okay. And I should ask, um, has he been hitting all his milestones? Like is he doing the things that his peers are doing? Yeah. I would say he's keeping up with his, his peers in daycare and, uh, no, no concerns with his development. Okay. Good. Is he on any medications? No medications. No. Okay. And is he up to date with all his immunizations? He is. Yes. Okay. And, um, any allergies? Um, got that we're aware of. Okay. Any family history of lung conditions? Um, no, no family industry, prevent any lung conditions. Okay. And, uh, so who does, who does he love with at home? So, um, you know, my, uh, myself, um, and, uh, his father and then sister. So there's just the four of us at home. Okay. And, uh, what's the relationship like between all of you? Is there any, uh, domestic issues, um, or, are things okay? Oh, things are, are great at home. Okay. Is there at least supportive environment? Okay. Good. And does anyone smoke at home? No one smokes at home. No. Okay. Um, any carpets at home? Old carpets? I think there's a few area rugs around, but most of the carpets are gone. Okay. Okay. All right. So it sounds like from what you're telling me, he... Oh, sorry, I should have asked you this earlier. Has he had any issues breathing? No problem. No problem breathing, but his voice does sound a bit... a little bit off, a bit husky. A bit husky? Okay. All right. And nothing like a seizure, like a febrile seizure, right? No. I haven't seen any like limb jerking or anything like that. Okay. So just roughly doing... from the sounds of it, it sounds like he has a serthroat that's been persistent. And we do this thing called a centorscore. So it sounds like he's had a fever, no cough, sore throat. So the first thing that we'd want to check to see or to rule out would be a strep throat. And then, well, if that comes back negative, we'll go from there and think about other viral causes for a strep throat as well. Did you have any questions or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today? No, we were thinking that it could be maybe strep throat. So yeah, thank you. Okay, great. Thank you.",
