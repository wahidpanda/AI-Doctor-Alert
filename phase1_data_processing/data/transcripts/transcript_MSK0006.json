  "transcription": "What brings you in? I've had this pain in the right blood-uck area. It's been really intense. And more recently, I'm feeling it like radiate. Just down my right leg as well. OK. And sorry, when did you say it started? So if we're going on for, well, it's gotten really intense in the last two days. OK. And before that, did you have anything at all or was it just like sun? Yeah, I do have a bit of pain down in my end-in-night blood-uck area. But it's just gotten really more painful over these last couple of days. OK. And is it a persistent kind of pain or does it come and go? It's persistent. It does get worse though, depending on what I'm doing. OK. When does it get worse? It gets worse with walking, with sitting really any kinds of movements. I just kind of stay still. And that's the only thing that really helps it. OK. Have you tried anything for it? Yeah. I've just stated in some pain medications over the counter for these last couple of days like that Abil and Pylonol, but that's it. OK. And is it helping? It does. I mean, not really. It hasn't really helped much. OK. And if you were to describe the quality of the pain, would you say it's sharp, dull, achy, throbby? It's like kind of like a sharp pain in the and the butt arc. And it's kind of like burning down the leg. OK. OK. So I would take your kind of pain. And then OK. And if you were to rate the severity of your pain, 1 to 10, 10, being the worst pain you've ever felt, what would you rate it? 8. OK. And does this pain radiate elsewhere? I know you said it starts on your butt, it kind of goes down your legs. Does it go up your back or down into the other leg at all? No. I feel it just on the butt, I can down the legs. OK. Have you ever experienced this kind of pain before? I have, yeah. I'm a truck driver. And so I do a lot of sitting. And I've had kind of sciatic pain in the past. OK. And have you ever had any trauma or anything that could have triggered this initially in the past? No, I don't think so. I haven't really done much. I just kind of worked and yeah, I haven't had any trauma to the back or anything like that. OK. And are you experiencing any sort of weakness with your legs? No. No weakness. Just while I'm... Yeah, I guess maybe a little bit of leg weakness. I've had a little bit of difficulty walking, but limping. Oh, I see. OK. OK. And just in your right legs, right? Yeah. Any urinary or stool incontinence? No. No. OK. Any sexual dysfunction? No, I haven't had anything like that. OK. Any numbness or tingling? Yeah. I've had some numbness and tingling down the right leg. OK. Have it in the groin area. No. It's just kind of down the back of my leg. OK. All right. And otherwise, do you have any other symptoms? No, it's just been just been this pain. OK. All right. And I'll just kind of go through some questions with you. Do you have any joint pains with muscle aches? Outslur? No. No weight loss? No weight loss? Feevers or chills? No fevers or chills? Rashes? And no rashes? Changes to your region hearing smell or taste? No. Are you coughing? I'm sure it has a breath or breathing? No. I haven't been having any symptoms like that. OK. Any chest pain, palpitations or dizziness or fainting spells? No. Nothing like that. OK. Anything just your bowel movements? No diarrhea or constipation? And no bleeding in the stool? No blood in the stool. And then how about nausea or vomiting? No. I haven't had any nausea or vomiting. OK. Changes to your urine? No. No changes to your urine. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding medical conditions? I do have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. And I take medications for those. I take amlotypine and a statin. OK. Do you have any other medical conditions? Are you on any other medications? The side's those? I just have a multivitamin. OK. And are you up to date with all your immunizations? I am, yes. OK. Any allergies? No, I don't believe so. No. Family issue of musculoskeletal or neurological issues? No. Nothing like that. Autoimmune conditions? No. Nothing like that. Cancer? No. No, OK. And do you smoke? Yeah, I smoke about half a pack of cigarettes per day. OK. For how long have you been doing that? For about 40 years. 40 years? OK. Have you ever thought of quitting? I have. Yeah. I've caught down over the years. I use to smoke more. It's just the culture with, I don't know, everybody's driving a truck and smoking. OK. Yeah, that's hard. If you ever need any resources, we have some that we can refer you to. Thank you. Yeah, no worries. And do you consume marijuana? No, I don't. OK. Have what other recreational drugs? No. Nothing like that before. OK. Do you drink alcohol? Yeah, I'll have a beer to you on the weekend, so maybe a couple of drinks per week. OK. And how about do you do a sick contest? Have you been in touch with any recently? No, I haven't been around anybody who's been sick. OK. Any travel recently? Just for the drop-offs that I make driving. I do have to make some pretty long halls back and forth. Yeah. OK. And where do you currently live? So I live in a house with my wife and son. OK. All right. And OK. So now I'm just going to move on to the physical exam part of this. And I'm going to ask you to do a few things. OK. So just by looking at your legs or if you have a mirror and you can look at your right buttock area, do you see any swelling or redness? No, I don't see anything like that. OK. And does it feel hot? No, it doesn't feel hot. OK. And do you see any skin changes? No skin changes. Any atrophy or deformity in the area? No. No. Has your date changed? Are you limping, hobbling, anything like that? Yeah, I feel like I've been limping a little bit. Yeah. Are you putting more pressure on the left foot then? I am. Yeah. Yeah. I guess it's like an entailed rigate. OK. All right. And then if you press down on your hip bone, do you feel any pain there on your right hip bone? No, I don't. OK. How about when you press down on your buttocks itself? I, yeah. There is a little bit of tenderness over the buttock area. OK. How about the back of your legs? No. How about there? OK. How about the front of your like size? No. No? OK. All right. And then I'm going to just get you to do a few movements with me as well. Would you ask, OK, so are you sitting down right now? Yeah. OK. Would you mind standing up from a sitting position? Yeah, for sure. Does that hurt? Yeah, that causes pain. OK. So that causes it. So on hip extension, that causes some pain. And as well as knee extension. So would you mind kicking your right leg up in front of you all the way up as far as you can go? Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. It does, yeah. So right hip flexion also causes pain. And then would you mind folding your knees backwards and just sort of flexing it? Does that hurt? No. OK. So no pain on knee flexion. And have a when you point your feet and toes up towards the ceiling. Yeah. Yeah. I do get some pain when my, yeah, when that's all straightened out. Yeah. OK. So some pain on plantar flexion at the right foot. And have it if you point your feet and toes towards the ground. No pain there. OK. All right. And have a when you kick your legs to the side and upwards. Oh, no pain with abduction. OK. So no pain on right hip abduction. And then how about when you bring it back down? No. OK. And no pain on hip abduction. OK. Well, those were all the questions that I have for you. Do you have any questions from myself? Just wondering about possibly like what it could be. Yeah. So it sounds right now like you may have some sort of a sacral nerve ridiculous epithee or like a lower lung bar ridiculous epithee. And basically that's known as sciatica where your nerve roots can become pressed causing some of these symptoms. And to diagnose these things, usually it's just done by history and physical exam. But if after we try out some management things, it doesn't go away or you're having some red flags, including numbness in the groin area, bowel or bladder and continents, then we can look at some imaging for the spine, including MRI. And so in terms of management of this, we can try a couple of like conservative approaches first. So that includes taking NSAIDs for the pain and then like activity modification. So if you're sitting down all the time, perhaps like taking little breaks, stretching out your legs, doing some physio as well during those breaks can help. And as well, I'm going to give you a referral for physical therapy. And they'll do some exercises with you and slowly increase those exercises. And if those still don't work, we can try steroids, steroid injections as well. We talked about the imaging if it doesn't go away in about six to eight weeks. Does that sound OK? Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. OK, yeah, no problem.",
