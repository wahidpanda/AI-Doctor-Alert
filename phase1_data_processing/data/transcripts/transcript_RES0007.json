  "transcription": "I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in. Yeah, so like a couple months ago, I was in the office and they told me that I've asked not like I had it when I was a little kid and I thought I grew out of it. But apparently not or like it came back or something. So, um, yeah. So they just told me to come back today. I don't really have like any issues. Okay. So, um, what what brought on the appointment in the summertime or a couple of months ago? So like I have gym class at school and my teacher just always saw it. Like I should be able to run faster. Like I'm like a good athlete, but I just could go much faster. And then like saying, I can't really breathe when I'm running that fast. And then you know, my mom is like, you should probably go and she'll probably make an appointment. Okay. And when you're exercising or in gym class, do you get short of breath? Or do you find that you have difficulty breathing? Yeah, yeah. Like I try to run fast. Kind of can't breathe anymore. So I kind of stop or go slower. Okay. And how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away? Look if I stop doing like the thing I'm doing it. I don't know. Not very long. A couple of minutes. Okay. And does this happen in any other settings? Sometimes when it's really cold outside, I'll go out and like my chest feels tight and feel like I can't breathe. And kind of sucks. Like when girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow angels and stuff and I couldn't do it. Oh, and another time like I went to my friend's house and they had like a bunch of cat. I felt like that weasy sound and I thought like that time it took longer for the breathing to get easier that I had to leave. Okay. So you've noticed changes to your breathing sounds like you've had noisy breathing before? Yeah, mostly just with the cat. Okay. We don't have a cat at my house. So I didn't really think anything of it. And then I went to my friend's house who had a bunch of cats. And at that time I could actually hear it. No, okay. And have you had a cough? No, I don't think so. Okay. And were there anything, was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away? Like I have the inhaler that the doctor gave me last time. So, so yeah, like I've been using that in gym class now. Okay. How many days per week are you using that? Yeah. Well, I'm a little confused now because I, the one I'm supposed to use like every day a couple of times and then there was a different one that I thought it was only supposed to be used if the other one didn't work. But now the nurse just told me that I'm supposed to use them both. So I only got the one at the pharmacy. So I don't really, I don't really know. I feel like a bit confused now. But I always use the one, both to be like two times a day, so I'm sorry to the nap. But sometimes I just do it one today if I forget the second one. Okay. Well, we could definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today. Sometimes for steroid medications, those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximum benefit. And so we'll take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and how often you're needing it. Have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at night time? Oh, no. Mostly like gym pasta, like I said. Okay. And have you had any other associated symptoms? I don't think so. Like what do you mean? So anything like allergies, like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like eye tearing? When I was around the cat, yeah. But not the other time. Okay. And do you ever have any rashes on your skin or really itchy skin? When I was a kid, but not really now. Okay. And how about any nausea or vomiting? No. You're okay. Any infectious symptoms overall? Hey, I don't think so. Okay. Any urinary problems? Uh, like, no. Okay. Um, any bowel problems? I don't know. No, that's all good. Okay. And any fevers or chills? Uh, no. Okay. And then how about having any night sweats? What's that? Uh, so overnight when you're sleeping, you'd wake up with either your, like pajamas, drenched or your, your sheaths drenched, drenched from sweating? Oh, no. Okay. I'm not that. Okay. So I just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health. Have you been, so you mentioned asthma? Uh, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions? Uh, no, no, that's it. Okay. Um, and any recent hospitalizations? Hmm. Like, I broke my leg years ago, but like, that was just like really fast. Okay. Uh, any surgeries? Uh, just like my wisdom teeth. Okay. And, um, any medications? These side, like, including the, um, inhalers? Uh, nothing else. Just those things and my mom makes me take a vitamin. Okay. And any allergies? Uh, well, I don't know. I like not that I thought, but maybe like cash. Okay. And do you have any six, like, seasonal allergies? Do you find like, in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get some, uh, like dry eyes or really itchy eyes or runny nose? Uh, yeah, I was just not like I had a cold, but I guess like I usually feel like that in the spring time. Okay. Um, and, uh, are your immunizations up to date? Uh, I think so. Like I've had all the stuff that I'm, that I'm supposed to do, I think, I don't know the names of everything. Okay. And, uh, so actually, I just wanted to ask a few questions about, uh, personal and kind of lifestyle habits, but, uh, first I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation. Yeah, like I love with my mom and dad and, uh, my little brother. Uh, okay. Yeah. Okay. And, uh, where do you go to school? Um, to, to the school, not like high school down the road. Okay. And it will grade now. Um, I'm in grade 11. Okay. And, uh, what types of, um, uh, like hobbies or kind of activities are you interested in? Uh, like I like playing video games. Um, I was really wanting to, uh, join the Marines and I was really trying to get into that stuff. Yeah, but then I heard like you can't, when you have asthma. Uh, so I kind of want to know about that. Like is that going to stop me from doing that? Yeah. So it's something that, um, we'll, we'll look into today. I'm not too sure what the details are, uh, um, regarding that information, but thank you for bringing that up and we'll be, uh, for sure to look into that together. Um, and that reminded me of a question I wanted to ask earlier. Um, and so have you had pulmonary function tests, uh, done before? Uh, what is that? So, um, essentially they'll have you kind of breathing into a tube, um, where you'll have, uh, periods where you'll maximally inhale and then, uh, maximally exhale as quickly as you can. Uh, you'll do different, um, types of, uh, breathing, uh, movements so that it gets measured on a, on a device. Oh, like, is that like when you breathe in the tube? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, like the last time I was here, like, probably a month ago, I did that and he said that my asthma was back. Okay. Thank you for clarifying. Um, and so, uh, so for the last few questions about, um, uh, the personal habits I was wondering, I understand that people, um, in your age group, might experience with smoking or, or alcohol, do any of your friends do that? Uh, I mean, sometimes we'll drink beer like at parties on the weekend. I don't, I don't drink a lot. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about your death? Sorry, I missed that. Um, there's just one, I wonder, uh, can you tell me a little bit about your diet? Oh, uh, well, I'm always, um, like makes me, uh, a lunch, like I'll have like a sandwich for lunch. Like, you know, ham and cheese or something. We usually have like, cereal for breakfast. I'm all mixed in, and I usually like, meat and like, potatoes and vegetables or something. And I think it's like pretty normal. Okay. Um, and, uh, are you currently sexually active? Uh, uh, like I have a girlfriend, um, like just with her, uh, like this recently. Yeah, we started. Okay. And, um, do you use a condom? Yeah. Yeah. Every time or, um, sometimes. Oh, yeah, every time. It's nothing at many times, but yeah. Okay. Great. And, um, have you had any other partners? Oh, no, no, like I had made out with other people before, but this is like the first one. Okay. Have you had us actually transmitted infection before? Uh, no. Okay. And, um, I know this, uh, question might seem, um, a little bit invasive, but it's important to ask everybody. Um, have you had any thoughts of hurting or harming yourself? No. Okay. I have it. Okay. Great. Um, and, uh, in, in your family, has anybody ever had any of these similar symptoms before? Uh, like my, my dad, I think he maybe had us when he was younger, but like he doesn't really have it now. Okay. Uh, and any allergies that run in the family? Hmm. Like my, my dad also, my dad gets like a runny nose in the spring. So, yeah, I think that's allergies. Okay. Um, so overall, it's, it's sounding like, um, even having this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing episodes that you're saying that it's made worse when you're exercising out in the cold. And then around pets and sometimes when the season changes as well in the spring and so, and then, um, with a recent diagnosis on, pulmonary function tests a few months ago. Um, so I think it would be important to, uh, clear up the medications today and try to get that, um, better organized moving forward because it sounds like you're still pretty symptomatic, um, with needing to use them. Um, daily, currently. And so, uh, we'll look into that and then also the question about, uh, the marine, um, um, interest with, uh, asthma. Yeah. Thank you. I really want to know that. Like that was my plan and now I'm kind of worried I can do that. Excellent. Okay. Thank you.",
