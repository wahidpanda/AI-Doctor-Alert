  "transcription": "And what brings you to the emergency department today? Low back pain. OK. And where exactly is the back pain? So the pain's just reated in the lower back. Just in the lower back? OK. And when did this pain start? It started yesterday. I was unloading groceries for my pickup truck. Wanted suddenly started. OK. And did you kind of make any kind of movements or do you pick up something really heavy? I bought sure. I just noticed the pain after that. And what kind of pain are you experiencing? Is it like a dull cramping pain or is it more like a sharp or standing thing? It feels like it's stabbing. Just reated my lower back. OK. And on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being like the least pain that you felt when you were 10 being the worst, how much would you rate this pain? If I'm sitting completely still, like I am right now, it's just a 2 out of 10. OK. And when does it get worse? Anytime I move or bend my back or even cough, worsens the pain significantly. OK. And has this pain changed at all since yesterday? No, it's been this same awful pain this whole time. OK. And have you ever had this kind of pain before? I've had a back pain over the years, but nothing like this before. And does it pain going where? Does it just stay in the lower back? I also feel the pain into my right leg. And is it staying kind of aching or like stabbing pain that goes into your right leg? Or is it just like aching pain? It's an aching pain. And do you have any other symptoms besides the pain? Like are you experiencing any kind of weakness or any kind of any other changes in your health? No. It's just the low back pain. OK. And have you ever experienced any kind of trauma to your back, like something that's hit you or you fall down, anything like that? No, I can't remember any injuries like that in the past. Any fevers or chills or night sweats? No fever, no chills, no nights sweats. Any symptoms of feeling really tired, the teen didn't feel like that? No, it'd been OK recently. Any changes to your skin at all? Any emotions? OK. Any pain in your joints at all? Just the back pain. OK. Any new coughs or any symptoms or any needles or anything like that? No. Any changes in your bowel movements at all? Like that? Are your constipation or anything? Nothing like that. You've been regular. And how about any urinary problems? No, nothing to report there. OK. And how is your appetite been? Apatite's been normal. Any significant rate loss or weight gain recently? No, the way it's been the both the same. OK. Any recent infections that you know? No, I've been feeling well otherwise. Any tingling sensation or numbness in your back or lower limbs in your legs? No numbness or tingling? OK. Any muscle weakness at all? No muscle weakness. And even having any kind of a irritable dysfunction? No concerns with erectile dysfunction. And any issues with incontinence, like having accidents at all at night or during the day? No, I haven't had any problems with bowel or bladder incontinence. OK. All right. In terms of your past medical history, have you been diagnosed with any conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes? Type 2 diabetes. OK. And you take any medications for it? Insulin for diabetes. OK. And any other medications at all? Just been taking Tylenol for the back pain. And has that worked for you at all? Or has it, you know, a different? Maybe it's taken the edge off a little bit, but it hasn't done too much to help the pain. OK. Any allergies? Nope. Any previous surgeries? I had hemorrhage removed three years ago. OK. Any hospitalizations before? Nope. Those are just day surgery. OK. Any family history of any conditions, or like incansures? My father had prostate cancer. And currently right now, do you work? I'm a retired school teacher. OK. And where do you live? I live alone in a house not too far from here, actually. OK. And do you drink at all? OK, generally.

And for how long have you smoked at a school? About 40 years. 40 years? OK. And do you use any kind of recreational drugs? I never. OK. And how's your diet going on in regular basis? I feel like it's pretty normal, mostly home cooked meals. It was a variety of vegetable vegetables, other meats and fish. I would say it's pretty balanced. OK. All right. I need some few more questions for you. Are you currently sexually active? Yes, I am. OK. And who are you sexually active with? Any new partners at all? No new partners. Just my girlfriend. And how many? Sorry. Go ahead. Oh, just my girlfriend recently. OK. And have you been sexually active with more than one partner in the past year? Yes, I have two women over the past year.
