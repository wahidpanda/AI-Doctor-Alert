  "transcription": "My back is just really hurts. I feel really stiff in the morning. And yeah, it's just been going on for a few months now. Okay, so for a few months, stiffness in the morning. So your back hurts, where exactly would you say it hurts? It kinda hurts all over. I can't really pinpoint any specific locations that hurt most. It kinda hurts all down my back. Okay, all the way up to, I guess, your neck and all the way down to your lower back. I wouldn't really say the neck. I guess more of the lower parts, maybe the middle of my back and down. Okay, and what kind of pain would you say it is? Is it like a dull aching pain? Is it a sharp stabbing pain? How would you describe it? It's a dull pain. Dull pain, okay. And on a scale of 0 to 10, would there be an elis amount of pain you felt in your life and 10 being the worst? How much would you rate it? It's about a four or five. I mean, some days it can be better, but, yeah, some days it can be worse. Okay. And when did this start? I think this started about four or five months ago. It's been going on, yeah, for probably about half a year now. Okay. And when it first started, was there anything that caused the back pain, like any kind of trauma or injury, anything that you can think of that might have led to this? No, nothing that I can think of. It's sort of, it's come on so slowly, like when I first started noticing the back pain, it was maybe like a zero to a one. I didn't really notice it too much, but over these last five, six months, it has gotten a bit worse. Okay, so it kind of came on progressively. It didn't just come on suddenly at some point. Right, yeah, it's been getting worse. Okay. And have you ever had any previous episodes that are similar to this? Not my back pain. I do get pain in my right knee and in my hands sometimes, but those pains just kind of come and go. Okay, when did those pains start? Those ones started probably, ever similar timeline around six months ago. Okay. Okay, and the back pain that you're having, does it radiate or move to any other part of your body? No, I don't feel it anywhere else. Okay, and have you tried anything that has helped relieve some of the pain in medications or anything? Yeah, I've tried some Tylenol and Advil and the Advil's actually helped taking the adjocl a little bit, but the next morning, I have the stiffness and pain again. Okay. And for your pain, are there any kind of factors that make the pain worse, like bending down or standing straight up or laying down anything that makes your pain worse? No, nothing that I can think of that really makes it any worse. Okay. And is your pain worse when you wake up in the morning or is it worse as the day progresses? It's worse in the morning. It gets a bit better as the day goes on. I ask you about an hour into the day, I feel my best. It takes a little bit of time to move around a little bit first. Okay, and approximately how much time would you say after you wake up the stiffness and pain goes away? I would say maybe 30 to 60 minutes. Okay. All right. And you haven't had any trauma injuries in recent years? No trauma or injuries. Okay. And no fevers or chills? No. Okay. Any night sweats? No. Any fatigue or malaise? Yeah, I have been a bit more fatigue than usual. And yeah, I've had some malaise as well. And for how long have you had this? It's been similarly getting a little bit more progressive. I mean, some days I'm just feeling like I just want to lay around and rest because I'm feeling just so burnt out and other days I'm okay, but I'm certainly more tired than usual. Okay, let's see. Other than that, have you noticed any kind of rashes or skin changes or changes in your nails at all? No. I haven't noticed any rashes or any nail changes. Okay. Any shortness of breath? No. Any changes in your bowel movements or urinary patterns? No, I haven't had any diarrhea or any urinary problems. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements or urinary patterns? No, I haven't had any diarrhea or any urinary problems. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or your weight? No, my appetite's been normal and my weight's been stable. Okay. And have you noticed any difficulties or changes with your vision or any eye problems? No, I haven't noticed anything like that. Okay. Have you noticed any kind of numbness or tingling sensation or your limbs specifically like your back and your legs? No, no tingling or numbness. Okay. Any muscle weakness at all? No, I haven't noticed any muscle weakness. Okay. And have you been sick at all recently with any viral or bacterial infractions? I had, I mean, I was diarrhea like several months ago and I had some antibiotics, but that was it. Yeah, so a few months ago. Okay. And other than that, currently are you sexually active? Yes, I am. I have a girlfriend and we started dating about six months ago. Okay. And do either of you have any history of any STIs at all? No history of STIs. Okay. All right. And is your partner fine or is she having any symptoms at all? No, she hasn't been having any symptoms and we've been using a condom mostly. Okay. Right. And otherwise, are you generally healthy or do you have any medical conditions? Yeah, I'm generally, I do have asthma actually. And just I had diarrhea a few months ago after eating at a buffet. So I think maybe it was food poisoning or maybe something like that. But yeah, so asthma and that's it. And do you use any medications for your asthma? Yeah, I'll use the blue inhaler. Sometimes I guess the just when I need it. But that hasn't been very often. Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications or any environmental factors? I do have environmental allergies. I'm not sure if it's like regweed or pollen, but something like that. Okay. And have you had any hospitalizations or previous surgeries? Never. Okay. Any family history of any medical conditions, any autoimmune conditions or any musculoskeletal conditions? Yeah, my mother has a psoriasis. Okay. Yeah. So she's had to, I don't use like creams and stuff like that for her skin. Okay. And currently right now, do you work? I do, yeah. I work at a bank. Okay. And your mother says she had psoriasis. Did she ever have any control? Did she have all kinds of psoriasis? I don't believe so. I think she had just issues with her skin. Okay. And so you work and then what's her living situation? Yeah. So I live with my girlfriend in a condo in the city here. Okay. And do you use any rectory food drugs like marijuana? Yes, sometimes. Yeah, I also smoke at once or twice per week with a friend or something like that. Okay. And do you smoke? No cigarettes, no. Never. Okay. And do you drink alcohol? Sometimes you all have a beer two on weekends or a cocktail with friends. Okay. All right. So those were just some of the questions I had. Now I'm just going to quickly ask some specific questions. So have you noticed any kind of swelling in the areas that you are having pain or redness or anything like that? No, I haven't noticed really any redness or swelling. Okay. And no. So are you able to bend down and stand up straight or extend backwards without pain or are you in any pain? Okay. I do get a bit stiff. I... Yeah, I'm not really too sure. Like not really. It's more stiff. Okay. And yeah, other than that, do you have any questions or concerns? Yeah, I was just wondering. Yeah, like what this could be possibly? Yeah, so definitely what... So this seems like it started of like three months to six months ago and it's been going on and it's happening in the morning. How old did you say you were? I'm 2026. Okay. Yeah, so in a team's progressive and you're getting some pain and your other joints as well. And it's mainly from your middle to lower back. It can be multiple things that you would have to rule out. So first you have a family history of psoriasis so it can be psoriatric arthritis. You don't have any other skin changes or any other symptoms. It can also be since you have had a... You were sick four months ago with what might be gastroenteritis. It can be... Sometimes a few months afterwards you can get something called the active arthritis where you get this progressive pain and your joints and stiffness. And otherwise it can also be something called enter losing spondylitis which can present in your age and it's kind of like a progressive doll back pain and that has some morning stiffness as well. So yeah, there's definitely multiple things that it can be. So first we would need to do a full physical examination and book an appointment for that in person. And we'll get some lab work done as well as an x-ray of the spine and your sacral aliac joints. And we'll also get some blood work with CBC, CRP and ESR. So those are just inflammatory markers as well as the rheumatoid factor and can you clear antibodies. So there's just some things that will test for a different kind of rheumatoid-logical issues and to see if you have any arthritis. So yeah, those are... And then we'll also get an x-ray of your hands and knees since you're having pain there as well. So yeah, those are some steps that will take... Do you have any questions or things, James? No, that sounds great. Thank you. All right, yeah. So we'll get in touch with you shortly. Sounds great. Thank you. All right, take care. All right. Bye.",
