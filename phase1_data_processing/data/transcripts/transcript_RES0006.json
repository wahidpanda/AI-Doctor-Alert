It's usually always produces like That sputum and it's usually a white or yellowish and clear Okay, and How much sputum are you producing each day?

Not as frequently I would say not really it just started in the last two to three months Okay, and have you had shortness of breath like this before? Just throughout my life I've had asthma so When I am exercising too much or get exposed to like dust Sometimes after shortness of breath Okay, has there been anything Besides the exertion yourself that's made that either the cough or shortness of breath worse Over the last year like I've had a couple chest infections After going to the ER and they gave me some antibiotics But yeah when that happens it usually gets worse the shortness of breath and the cough okay, and Your symptoms feel like any of those times right now No, I don't feel like I have a fever and No other symptoms just the shortness of breath and cough Okay, and have you been doing anything that's made it better? I've been seeing some talent all cold hasn't really helped too much I've tried my inhalers They sometimes helped but I've never had This frequent coughing and shortness of breath before okay And how is your energy been have you been experiencing fatigue? When it gets really bad then I can't really step out of the house But other than that I feel like my energy is still there Okay, and you have have you had any fevers or chills?

Are there any other medications you're currently using? No, just the salbutamol and like the steroid inhaler Okay, and how often are you using both of those? So the steroid when I using pretty much every day but uh The Salbutamol I found I've been using a lot more recently, I would say probably at least six to ten times in a week Okay um I had a reminder to me I forgot to ask um Have you noticed any changes to your voice? Uh, no not really Okay And I was wondering if you had any allergies to medications? No, not that I know Alright, and have you been in the hospital recently? Nope Alright, so when was the last time that you had any biotics? I would say like six months ago Okay, and any surgeries? Nope Okay um And do you get the flu shot this year?

No, no pets Alright, and um, any exposures that work to like dust or um, any types of like chemicals like that? Uh, no, not really if my work is pretty much a dust job, so nothing like that Okay um, and do you smoke cigarettes?

So I'm 60 years old now Okay, so you started smoking um, around 35 Yeah, yeah, okay Um, have you tried to quit? Yeah, I've tried to quit, I've even quit a couple of times, but then just go back onto it Yeah, not not really ready to quit Okay That's fair enough if there's something that you wanted to talk about quitting smoking at another appointment, we um, can arrange follow up for that Um, do you drink alcohol? Uh, not that much, just to I would say one or two beers on the weekend All right, uh, and do you use any recreational drugs like cocaine, crystal bath No, or ibidrux No, nothing like that all right um, and is it anything similar like this happened to your family before? Uh, I think my sister has uh, COPD like she smokes a lot too um But that's that's a but I don't know if that's genetic Oh, okay um Um, so uh, anybody in the family have cancers? Uh, no, not that I know of All right um So um That that was all the questions that I wanted to ask on history um, was there any uh Anything other questions that you had? Uh, I know not really just wanting to get to the bottom of this Okay, for sure so um We will um run some investigations and Kind of like we get a a chest x-ray um Because it's been a couple of months that these symptoms have been going on for um But I think it could be related to your smoking and most likely um Uh, bronch chronic bronchitis, but um We can definitely um, we'll be looking into this and then also with um possibly some pulmonary function tests as well Okay, sounds good",
