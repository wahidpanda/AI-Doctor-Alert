  "transcription": "45 year old female with right knee pain. Hi, my name is Chris. I'm a medical student in the clinics today. How may I help you? Hi, Chris. So I'm just having this pain in my knee since I just fell this three days ago slipping on the stairs. Since then I've been having a lot of pain. I see. So did this pain start right after falling on the stairs? Yeah, I've been having the pain since then. Okay. That was three days ago. Three years ago. Okay. And you're feeling the pain in your right knee? Yeah, in my right knee. Okay. And what would you say the character of the pain is, or how would you describe the pain? It's kind of like a dull, aging pain. Okay. And has the pain been getting any better or any worse? It's kind of getting worse, actually, just in my right knee, as well as my whole right calf as well. Okay. What is the intensity of the pain on a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you've ever felt? Probably around the six. Okay. And did your knee hurt before this at all? Or did you have any trauma to the leg before? No, no. Before three days ago, before my slip, I was fine. Okay. Are you feeling the pain anywhere else besides your right knee? In my calf, I'm getting a lot of pain as well in my right calf. Okay. Is there been anything that's made the pain worse? Yeah, if I am walking or if I'm moving that leg and putting weight on it, it's definitely worse. So it's definitely like better if I just stay seated and stay resting. Okay. Is there anything, excuse me, resting? Is there anything else that's helped? I did take some, which did help for a few hours, but then it just kind of ran back to the same. Okay. And have you had any associated symptoms with the right knee and calf pain? Yes, I also think there's some swelling in my right calf as well since yesterday. Okay. Okay. There's some swelling there. Have you noticed if your calf was red or if there was a rash over it? I don't see any rashes or redness, but it definitely does seem swollen and then it hurts as well when I move it or press it. Okay. And when you felt, did you injure any other parts of your body like your hands or wrists? Just a few scratches on my hands, but nothing too bad. And how about your head? Did you lose consciousness or hit your head? No, no, I didn't hit my head at all. I caught myself before then and no, I didn't lose any consciousness. Okay. Okay. Have you had any fevers or chills? No. Okay. Have you had any chest pain? No. Have you had any cough? No cough. Have you had any shortness of breath? No. Okay. Have you had any dizziness or lightheadedness? No. Okay. And have you had any heart palpitations or feeling like your heart is racing? No, nothing like that. Okay. And have you had any infectious symptoms such as like a runny nose or sore throat? No, nothing like that. Okay. And have you had any nausea vomiting? No. Have you had any abdominal pain? No. Okay. Have you had any changes to your bowel movements like diarrhea or more constipation? No. Nothing like that. All right. So have you had any urinary problems? No. All right. Have you had any recent weight changes? No. Nothing like that. Okay. And have you noticed any... It rashes anywhere else over your whole body? No, not that. I've noticed. All right. Have you noticed any muscle weakness? No. Have you had any numbness to the skin? No. Not that I've noted, no. And have you had any tingling? No. Okay. And... In the past, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions? I do have some high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I see. And do you take any medications? Yes. A cholesterol. I'm taking like a crestermedication. And then a high blood pressure I'm taking a ramopro. Okay. Have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries before? No. I... No, I don't... Just besides a... A C-section for one of my children. I don't have any other surgeries. Okay. And have you had any thrombosis before or a blood clot in the past? No. I've never had anything like that. Okay. And have you been... So you've had the birth of your... You had a C-section. And have you been pregnant other times in the past? No. That was it. Okay. So have you had a miscarriage before? No. Okay. Any allergies to medications? No allergies. Okay. And... Could you tell me a little bit about your... Living situation currently, like you're living with. Whereabouts are you living? Yeah, I live with my husband and our daughter. And it's just in a small townhouse just in the city. Okay. And are you working currently? I do work from home. I'm actually just... I'm in a counting clerk, but I'm also my work is from home right now. Okay. And any exposures to anybody who's been sick? No. Have you traveled anywhere recently? No. Okay. And over the last couple of days, with the leg pain, do you feel as though you've been like immobilized? Yeah. I've been trying to just stay rested, just stay seated, otherwise it hurts a lot, especially after my fall. So I've tried to stay immobilized. Okay. For the last couple of days. Okay. And do you drink alcohol? No. And do you smoke cigarettes? No. No. I don't. I don't. I don't. No, I don't. Okay. Okay. So... Oh, and in the family, are there any history of heart or lung conditions? So, don't know about heart or lung conditions, but my mother had a stroke in her late 60s. My father is pretty healthy. Okay. Has there been any blood clots in the family before? I'm not sure about blood clots, but my mother had a stroke. Is that kind of like a blood clot? It could be. I stroke can have many different types of causes for it, and one of them could be caused by a blood clot, but I wouldn't be able to say for sure, just because there are so many different types or reasons for having a stroke. Okay. So, yeah, so you mentioned your leg has some swelling. Do you feel as though there's any... Like temperature change to your calf? Like, is it hot? I think... I don't know if it's maybe a little bit warm, but definitely swollen. And do you feel... Is there any pain to palpation? Like, if you touch your calf or something like that, is there pain? Yeah, if I touch my right calf, it's painful, and then if I press down on it, it's really painful. And then just on the outside of my right knee, if I touch or press down, it really hurts as well. Okay. And if you move your foot, so if you dorsiflex your ankle, or bending your toe up towards your nose, do you end up getting any calf pain? It's doing that at the whole moment test? Yeah, I'll try that out. I think it definitely hurts when I move my... I don't know if I could point my toes towards my nose. Okay. Okay, so I think... That was everything that I wanted to ask today on history. Was there anything else that maybe I missed? No, I think that's all. Okay. All right, so with the fall two days ago, things that I'm thinking about right now would be possibly a muscle strain, so this could be a gastrocnemius strain to the calf muscle itself, from the fall, which could have pain when you touch it, it could be some swelling, and it would be aggravated by movements. Also could be injuries to some of the ligaments there, as well. And however, with the swelling, the immobilization for the last two days, as well as the pain kind of being a bit progressive, with swelling and a positive home and test, and your temperature is a little bit elevated today, not quite a fever, but feverish. It does increase the suspicion for a deep vein thrombosis. And so I think the most likely thing right now is actually a DVT or deep vein thrombosis. And so we will order some diagnostic studies and get an ultrasound of your right calf, as well as an x-ray of the right knee to start. Okay. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you so much.",
