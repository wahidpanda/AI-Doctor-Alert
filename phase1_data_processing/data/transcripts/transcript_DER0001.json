  "transcription": "Hey Doc, I'm a 45 year old man. I'm just coming in. I'm worried there's a little rash on my leg. I'm getting nervous about. Hi. So I understand you have a rash on your leg. I don't really know what I would call it. That's what I told the nurse when I came in, but it's more hurts than anything. Right. How long have you been going on for? It's been looking weird for about a week, but only yes. It started hurting yesterday. It's sort of looking strange. And I just wanted to come in to get it checked out. OK. When you say it's looking strange, can you tell me what you mean by that? Slow one. It looks bigger than it did before. Meanor, if that makes sense. Slow one. OK. Is it red? Yeah, it's red. It's turning more red, kind of in the area around it. I've got these scabs. I've got diabetes and dogs. I think the best with it. I haven't scratched in at it. And normally it's not that bad, but this is just strange looking. There's no other word for it. OK. Have you ever had anything like this before? I guess you've kind of just said that you didn't, but I was double checked. No, no. Well, I've had occasional ulcers and sometimes I've banged my toe, not exactly the best, taking care of my feet, but this is the first time I've gone something that I've just never seen it before. OK. Do you have any ulcers right now on your feet? I think so. When I last saw this little family dog, I think I've got an ulcer on my left heel, but I think it's doing all right. OK. And what leg are you having this problem with right now? So I'm right. So my ankle. OK. How have your sugar been controlled, breaking me? I just thought measuring them. Yeah, last time I measured it was pretty bad. I think I A1C last time was like nine and something. I'm trying better to be with it. This is hard with work, you know? For sure, I can imagine. So in general, even if you don't know your number for your sugar, have you felt worse than usual lately? Have you felt run down at all? Yeah, actually I have. Being more and feel hungry sometimes is tired, but how? No, it's hard to tell. There's an off-lock going on in my life right now with the kids, but it's hard to tell. I think, yeah, I need to see my family dog. OK. Definitely, you know, a good idea moving forward just to make sure you get on top of these things. But I'm glad you came in today. So we can, you know, have a better look at you and make sure that there's nothing super concerning going on. So in addition to this, have you had any other new symptoms? Symptoms, I feel a little hot actually. When the swelling started, it also started leaking this like white stuff from one of the, what used to be a scab. So now, like kind of open room now. OK. OK. So when did you start feeling hot? Honestly, last 12 hours. OK. Can you take your temperature at all? No. I don't have a thermometer at home. Have you had any difficulty breathing? No. No. Any testing? Nope. Have you noticed that your left, sorry, your right leg feels any hotter than the left? Yeah. Yeah, it does actually. Changing socks the other day. Yeah. Hey, have you like, have you felt ill recently? Have you been sick at all? Hmm. Aside from just feeling a little crummy last couple of weeks, no. Don't really less energy today. But I was up last night thinking about this. Yeah. Wanted to come in and talk. Yeah, I'm, you do the right thing. I'm glad that you're in today. Is the pain on your leg worse when you catch it? Yeah. Maybe not so much when I touch it. When I walk with it and I start flexing it, it doesn't like that. OK. OK. Just resting it right now. It feels fine. It's OK. OK. OK. Well, I'm going to, if I think of any more questions specifically about your leg, I will go back to it. But I'm going to move on. And ask you two questions about your overall health. You've already shared with me that you are diabetic. Do you have any other chronic conditions that you live with? On condition. See the family talk about cholesterol. If you want to pill for that. Had asthma as a kid. I'll talk about your initial know. And my back, I've had back pain for the last 10 years. But I don't know what it really takes for its Tylenol at build for that. Oh, my other question about your leg is, have you lost any feeling in it? No. It kind of like a doll egg sometimes when I touch it. But no, like in the area, the ankle, no. But definitely on my feet, like over the years, I've noticed. I feel less on it, and heard what I did previously. Yeah. OK. That makes sense. OK. So I talked to her. So we talked about diabetes. You said you have my cholesterol. So what medications are you currently taking? I'm taking four pills right now. One of them is for the cholesterol. I think it's called Rasuvistatin. The other three, they're all diabetes medications. But I don't remember. That form is one of them. Sit a slum. I have a list somewhere. I'll get that to you later. OK. Are you on insulin right now? No. Are you on any of these medications new? Do you have a reason? No. No. I've had to provide a year now. Do you have any allergies? Yeah, I do, actually. Kind of selling. Can't take that. And what happens when you take Ted as a villain? It's been a while as a kid. Apparently, like, face got loaded. It was just have a hard time breathing. So OK. Well, we'll make sure that we don't give you that. Can you tell me if you've had any previous surgery? Yeah. What was it? I had my sinuses. I had some pretty bad sinusitis when I was in my teens. And they went in kind of carved a little bit of space out. OK. OK. Is that the only surgery that you've had? Yeah. But. And can you tell me do you have any family history of diabetes, in problem, anything else that stands out to you? Yeah. I'm side of the family. Anyone who has diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol. That side of the family is pretty healthy. I think maybe one of my aunts had lung cancer, which is a pretty big smoke, too. And I'm hoping I'll do a few questions about your lifestyle. So you said that you have children? Yeah, I do. Do you live in town? Do you live with your kids? I live in town. I see my kids over two weeks. And what do you do for work that I already asked you this? No, I'm currently unemployed. I'm looking for work. Partially employed, I suppose. You should say, I work in my own business. I see. And what do you do when you are working ideally? When I have working, I'm going to count. OK. Cool. And you smoke? Yeah, once in a while. Yeah. I'm stressed, though. I think I've got an average. Last couple of weeks, I've been smoking more. Maybe like two packs a week. OK. Do you drink alcohol? Yeah. Yeah. How much do you typically drink? Average week. Maybe a two, four. So maybe like three per day or something like that? A few were to average it out? Yeah, if you average it out, I may only go through the two, four a weekend to be honest. Oh, I see. OK. More so on the weekend. So maybe a little bit more than three per day back in on those days. OK. Oh, I think that that's everything that's out. I need to ask you for now. I'd like to get a closer look at this leg. Did you have any other questions or concerns before we move forward with the floor of your pants? No, I just want to get this figured out. Yeah, we'll definitely do that for you. So I'm going to have a look at it. And then I'll show that I will go talk to the doctor that I'm working with. And we'll see what we can do for you. Is that sound good? Thank you, doc. Yeah, sounds great. Awesome. OK. Thanks.",
