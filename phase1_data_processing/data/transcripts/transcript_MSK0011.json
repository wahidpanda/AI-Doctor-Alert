  "transcription": "what brings in here today? Yeah, yeah, last night. So having this pain in my right wrist, yeah, last night I tripped over something and I ended up landing on my hand to help break the fall. And this morning I woke up and I had some bruising on my hand and it's really sore to touch it. Okay, which hand is this? It's my right hand. Okay, and when you had your fall, when was your fall? So it was last night, probably like 10 pm, something like that. What out with a few friends for dinner and drinks? Okay, and do you remember how high you felt from or what you fell on to? Yeah, I was standing high. We were just kind of walking down the street and tripped over something on the curb. I think there was a like a poddle or something like that. And so I felt right onto the concrete with my hand. Okay, did you hit your head at all or lose consciousness? No, nothing like that. Okay, so it was mainly your hand that got injured. Yeah, it was mostly my hand. Okay, and are you having any pain on movement or if you press on it? Yeah, I do get some pain paying if I'm trying to move the wrist around and it hurts if you press on it as well. Okay, and do you notice any kind of swelling or bruising? I do, yes, they're swelling and bruising. Okay, and if you had to describe where the swelling and bruising and the pain are, how would you describe it? So I have a sharp pain right at my wrist, I feel it mostly at the base of my thumb kind of right at the wrist. And that's where the swelling and bruising is as well. Okay, and is it right under your palm or at the back of your hand on the wrist? At the back of the hand at the wrist and base of the thumb. Okay, okay. All right, and what kind of pain are you feeling is this sharp, is it dull, aching? Oh yeah, it's really sharp, it feels like sorry, it's stabbing me in the hand. Okay, and how much would you rate the pain on the scale of zero to 10, 10, being the worst pain you've felt in your life? If I'm not moving it around, it's a three, but if I move it, it goes up to like a nine on a 10. Oh, okay. And is it radiating or moving anywhere else on to your hand? No, I don't feel it anywhere else. Okay, and do you have any kind of pins and needles sensation, tingling or numbness anywhere in your hands? No, nothing like that. Okay, anything that makes the pain worse or better? Yeah, I tried some AT and flammatories, I did help with taking the edge off a little bit. But the pin just came right back and then also, like just moving it at all. It's even texting on my phone was really bugging me. Okay. Yeah, so you definitely, you went to, you had the fall yesterday or? Yeah, it was yesterday. Okay. Okay. All right. So when did it start hurting? Did it start hurting right away or has it gone worse at all? Yeah, it started hurting right away and it's, well, this morning it's a bit worse, yeah. Okay. Do you have any other symptoms at all? Like fever, chills, headache, anything like that? No. Any dizziness or feinting? No. Okay. Any diarrhea, constipation? No. Any changes in your vision, hearing, balance? No, nothing like that. Okay. But yeah, so your main concern today is this pain in your wrist? Yeah, exactly. Okay. All right. And do you have any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with? Yeah, I do. I have asthma and I use an orange inhaler. It gave me, and it's in well controlled. I'll use, I would use the blue one in a while. Okay, so it's pretty well controlled. Yeah. And do you take any other medications at all? I just did a multivitabin. Okay. And vitamin D as well. Okay. All right. And have you been hospitalized in the past or had any surgeries? Yeah, I have a ton of blood. If I was the teeth out when I was a teenager and, or tonsils when I was a kid, actually. And it's a second. Okay. Sun. Okay. Any complications at all with that at all? No, no. Every, every, that was okay. Okay. And have you injured your right hand or broken any bones before? No, I haven't. Okay. So this is the first injury on your right hand. Okay. And do you have any family history of any medical conditions at all? Yeah, my, my uncle died of a heart attack when he was at his 60s. I think my grandfather also had a heart attack as well. Yeah, that's what it is. Okay. And in terms of your work, do you do, do you work currently? Yeah, I do. I work in a restaurant. And so this will be difficult for my job coming up with an injured rest. I, and, and hand, I just restarted and I'll have to be carrying a lot of different things. And so I just hope it's not broken. Oh, I see. Yeah, it might definitely, and that might be concerning. You know, we'll get that track though on X-ray and everything. But we just need to do a few, few more questions and some examination as well. How would you describe your living situation right now? So I'm living, I'm actually in an apartment. Okay. And do you currently smoke? No, I've never smoked. I couldn't with having asthma. So I just did it away from home and that. Okay. And do you drink alcohol? Yeah, I do. I have a couple of bottles of wine per week. Okay. All right. A couple of bottles a week. So how much would you have in an average day? Oh, I guess probably like two or three glasses a one a day. Okay. Yeah. So we definitely recommend for women to limit themselves to maybe one to two max two glasses of one. And then we'll have wine a day as it can have health effects in the future in terms of drinking and then on your liver. Okay. And other than that, I just had a few questions. Any recreational drugs like marijuana? No, stay away from that as well. Okay. Okay. So I'm just going to ask a few questions about specifically to examine your rest. So you notice, so can you are you able to move your wrist around? Are you able to make a fist? I can, but I can't really bend my thumb. And it hurts a lot. So I can bend my fingers, but my thumb's kind of out. Okay. Do the joints in your thumb hurt at all? No. Okay. And any pain anywhere else like on your fingers or your elbow? No. Okay. And what movement would you say hurts the most? Um. Probably just moving the the wrist like flexing and extending the wrist. Okay. And where this following you said is at the base of the thumb, right? Yeah, exactly. At the base of the thumb on the on the back of the hand, there are some neck bruising and swelling there. Okay. Is it warm at all to touch? No, it doesn't feel warm. Okay. Um. Okay. And if you press on, uh, are you getting any, uh, bony pain in that area? Like if you put press on a bone? Yeah. Like I mean, if I, there's one spot that if I press down, um, it, it's like 10 of the 10 pain, it hurts really bad if I, uh, press at the base of my thumb there. Okay. All right. So those are all the questions I had for you today. Um, uh, we definitely need to, uh, since you're having, uh, pain on just puppy, puppy in the area, they're swelling, redness, and you did have a fall and you landed on your, um, you caught yourself with your hand. There is a common, uh, fracture that can happen in those circumstances, uh, um, to your wrist. And so we need to do an x-ray. And, um, we will see if you have a fracture or not, but we also need to, um, see if we need to get a cast for you or, uh, if, um, making an interior, um, injury with, um, a, a splint or, and then based on what we see in your physical examination, we'll determine how long you need to be in the cast or splint, um, and then, uh, walk off from there. Okay. That sounds good. Thank you.",
