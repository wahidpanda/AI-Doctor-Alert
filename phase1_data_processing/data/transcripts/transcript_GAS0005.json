  "transcription": "Would you mind by starting with what brought you in today? Yeah, so I'm just coming in with my son. He's six years old and yeah, just over the last few days, he's not been himself and he's been having this stomach ache. So which started around like, I would say three days ago. And then he's also having a vomiting for the last two days. He's vomited in total six times over the last two days. And then yesterday, he also developed a fever as well. And I managed to measure it and it was 38.3 degrees Celsius. Okay, I see. So just so that I'm understanding the timeline. So he started to have abdominal pain about three days ago. I started with having vomiting and diarrhea two days ago. And you checked his temperatures at a fever as of yesterday. Yeah. Okay. And was there anything that that he ate that was different over over the last few days? No, we've been strictly home food during like a pandemic, like no real changes. Okay. And what's his behavior been like over these last couple of days? Yeah. So I first with the stomach pain, he was a bit just irritable and just not himself, but especially yesterday with the fever, just been very quiet and just kind of sleeping pretty much the whole day. Okay. I see. And could you describe the vomit? Yes, vomit. Like started two days ago. The first day it was just like duped up things that he had eaten. But yesterday it was it was mainly just like just yellowish material. I couldn't really tell if it was food or not. Okay. Have you noticed any bile or blood in the vomit? No, I didn't notice any blood. And I didn't notice any green material. It was mainly just like normal vomit, like yellowish color. Okay. I see. And has the what was the vomiting triggered by anything that you're aware of? Like eating or drinking? Yeah. Two days ago it was after lunch, when he first vomited. But after that, it's just kind of random. I see. Okay. And in regards to his diarrhea, has there been any any blood or any color changes? No, no, I didn't notice any blood at all. It's definitely just very watery. And he's had to go probably even just in the last day, probably around like six or seven times. Okay. And he's vomited how many times? So in total, I can count six times. Okay. And has he been complaining about any headaches? So no, not that I know. Okay. And how about any ear pain or eye pain? No, not that he's mentioned to me. Okay. Any eye redness? Nope. Okay. And has he had a runny nose? No, not really. Okay. And has he had a sore throat or any pain with swallowing? No. Okay. Has he had any loss of taste or loss of smell? No, that's not that he's mentioned to me though. Okay. And has he had a cough? No, not really. Okay. And how about any shortness of breath or weezing? No. Okay. And has he had any pain anywhere in any chest pain? No, he did point to his stomach like it seems like he was having with all the vomiting like he was having some stomach pain as well. Okay. Is there any specific location that that he's feeling the pain? It's hard to say. He was just pointing at the center of his belly. Like I don't know if it's like I tried pressing on it and feeling pain then I think it's just kind of all over his stomach. Okay. And as he had any urinary problems like painful, boyding or being more often. No, he's been okay. Have you noticed any rashes or skin changes? No, not really. Okay. And has he had any muscle aches or joint pains that he's mentioned? No, he hasn't mentioned anything like that. Okay. And he's had a fever as he had chills. Yeah. So that's what prompted me to take his temperature yesterday around the afternoon. Like we had to wrap him up in like more than two blankets and he was still feeling cold. So yeah, definitely he was having chills. Okay. And and and have there been any concerns with his growth and other weight or height? So he's been playing all of the charts pretty well. Like your concerns during his growth. Otherwise he's a very healthy child. Okay. So no medical diagnoses previously. No, nothing like that. Okay. And and is he meeting all developmental milestones? Okay. It got a gross motor, fine motor. I'm doing well at school. Yeah. I mean, he's, yeah, and then didn't have any issues with walking, running. It's pretty social with all his peers. He's doing well at school. No complaints. Okay. Excellent. And to no medical conditions, but has there been any reasons for being in the hospital before? No, not at all. We, yeah, we haven't really gone to the doctor with him after like all those vaccinations I get to do. So he's been good. Okay. Great. So I'm immunizations are up to date. Yeah, immunizations all up to date. Excellent. And does he have any allergies? And no, not anything that we know of yet. Okay. And just wanted to ask about his birth history. Were there any complications throughout pregnancy, either mom being safe or having any, any issues herself? And also it was a normal, vaginal delivery. No issues. He was born at 39 weeks. Didn't need to stay in the hospital at all. Yeah, it was a pretty smooth pregnancy compared to some of the other ones. Okay. No, that's, that's great. Do you remember that appgar score or his birth weight? I don't exactly remember his appgar scores. I think they were like just, just, they were normal. Like there was nothing concerning about that. And birth weight, I think he was probably around three, three kilograms. Okay, great. So, and yeah, healthy birth weight at term, it sounds like. And so healthy, does he take any medications regularly? No, no medications. Okay. And can you tell me about who he's living with currently and who's looking after him? Yeah, so he's living with myself, his mother and, and my husband. And he has two older siblings. One is a boy, seven years old and another one, like a 10 year old girl. Okay. And has anybody in the house been sick? No, no one has been sick recently. However, he does, they did let them go back into school at one point. So I don't know, I don't know. So that was his last week. So I don't know if he caught something from school. Okay, but nobody that you know that's had similar symptoms. No, no, okay. And maybe travel anywhere. No, we've been, we've been at home. Okay. And then, yeah, no recent changes to anything in the diet you've mentioned. No, that's the plan. Okay. And any concerns for safety in the home, whether the physical or, or verbal abuse? No, no concerns like that. Okay. Yeah, a question that we have to ask everybody. And is there any smoking in the home? No, no, we don't smoke. Okay. Great. And are there any pets? No, no pets. All right. And in the family, has there been anybody who's had any heart problems or any lung problems? We are getting the ten year old tested for just asthma. Okay. But nothing diagnosed yet. Okay. Anybody in the family have any congenital diseases or any genetic diseases? No, not that I know. Hello. Okay. Anybody in the family have a silly act disease or, or Crohn's disease? No, no, no history of any kind of novel diseases. Okay. So I think that's everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything that maybe I forgot to ask or, or that I missed it? What do you want to tell me? Yeah, no, it's also just like I was just reading up. Can it be like, I don't know if it can be COVID as well, if it can, you can do this as well. It is possible. It's especially with non-specific symptoms, COVID can cause a variety of different presentations and there for some people it can be more gastrointestinal issues like your son has with vomiting and diarrhea and belly pain, but it also could be another type of gastrointestinal virus itself or a viral illness like the common cold, which can also end up causing symptoms like this as well. So we will go ahead and do a COVID test today along with some other but work and maybe increase the hydration as well. How it sounds like he has lost a lot of fluid over these last couple of days. So we'll check electrolytes and go from there on the test results. All right, sounds good. Thank you so much.",
