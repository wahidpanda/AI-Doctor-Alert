  "transcription": "I was wondering if you could tell us what brought you into CS. Yeah, so I just came in and I was a bit worried because I've been having this cough for around two years, which has been getting worse. But recently I've noticed that I see streaks of blood in this put on that I'm producing before just used to be like white. And now I'm seeing over the last, I would say two months, occasionally, some streaks of blood. Okay. And the cough started two years ago. Yeah. Okay. And it's been gradually getting worse over that time. Yeah, I would say so. It's getting more frequent and worse in nature. Okay. And how much speed of are you bringing up in a day? Probably like a couple of teaspoons. Okay. And is are you seeing like bright red blood when you're when you're coughing it up? In this, it's kind of mixed into this put on, I would say like, but it definitely is red. Okay. And how much blood would you say that you're you're bringing up with the teaspoons or a cup or no, it's just like a little streaks. It's not really significant. It doesn't feel like the whole production of this put on, but just like little streaks that up knows this. Okay. And is the cough worse at any particular time of day? It definitely gets worse when I'm doing more activities. And then also when I get like some viral infections, but other than that, it's pretty much always there. Okay. Anything that makes it worse, I use it said some viral infections. You have you had a viral infection recently? Yeah. Like in the last two years, I've probably had two or three viral infections. This just cold, cold symptoms. Has there been anything that you've tried to make the cough better? I've tried the time cold. Has it really worked? Tried to just other over the counter medications haven't really worked? Okay. And prior to two years ago, were you experiencing any similar symptoms like this cough for bringing up blood before in the past? I've always had somewhat of a cough like I have COPD. Okay. So I've always had a little bit of a cough here and there, but over the last two years, I feel that it's been getting much worse. Okay. Have you been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis before? Yeah, I think so. Okay. And so with this cough and now blood tinged, have you been experiencing any other symptoms? I do feel sometimes I get like more tired than I used to throughout the day. Okay. Sometimes I also feel more breathless when I'm exerting myself more. Okay. And have you been having any fevers or chills? No, no, I haven't. How about any night sweats? No. Have you lost any weight? Yeah, I've actually lost a significant amount of weight I would say. But then the last one and a half month, probably lost like eight to ten pounds. Okay. Have you been trying to lose weight? No, not really. I've just been sitting around like I can barely walk that much anymore to I used to be able to walk at least 400 meters around the block. But now I can barely even go to the kitchen. Okay. Is this because of the shortness of breath when you are exerting? Yeah, that and I just start coughing so much that I just have to sit down. Okay. And have you been having any headaches? No headaches. All right. And how about and how's your appetite been? I think it's been pretty much the same. Sometimes I'm coughing a lot. I don't feel like eating, but I'm not that it's been around the same. Okay. Any nausea or vomiting? No. Any runny nose or sore throat? Nope. Okay. And then how about a loss of smell or a loss of taste? No, nothing like that. Okay. Have you been having any chest pain? No. Any heart palpitations? No. Any wheezing when you're breathing? Sometimes I would say like when when it gets worse when I'm exerting myself more, I can get some reason. Okay. And have you noticed any swelling in your feet or ankles? No, nothing like that. All right. And have you woken up at night extremely short of breath? No, I'm pretty fine during the night. All right. And have you been having any abdominal pain? No. Any urinary problems? No. Any bowel problems like diarrhea or constipation? No, nothing like that. All right. Any skin rashes? No. Any joint pains or muscle pains? No. Any weakness? Not weakness. I'll just say more fatigue. All right. So I know you told me COPD, but do you have any other medical diagnoses? Yeah, I have high blood pressure as well. All right. I think I have high cholesterol too. I see. Okay. Do you take any medications regularly? Yeah. So the cholesterol I'm taking, those overstats in. And I forget what I'm taking for the blood pressure, but it's pretty well under control. Okay. You use any inhalers for COPD? I used to, I used to have, I think like three different inhalers, but haven't had to use them for two more than 10 years now. Okay. What was the reason for not needing them anymore? I just didn't have any symptoms for a pretty long time. And my docs said like, if I don't really need them, then I can just stop. Okay. And have you had any recent hospitalizations? No. Any allergies to medications? Nope. Any surgeries that you've had in the past? No surgeries. Okay. And are your vaccinations up to date? Yep. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about your social situation or living situation? Yeah. So currently I'm just living by myself in an apartment. I've been there for more than 10 years now. I'm retired, so I'm not working anymore. Yeah, that's me. Okay. Great. What did you do previously for work? Did you have any exposures for two chemicals or dusts or asbestos? Things like that nature? Oh, yes. So I worked in the steel factory for most of my working life. I think there might have been some exposures to chemicals and dust particles. Asbestos, I don't think there was exposure, but definitely I may have lived in places that had asbestos. Yeah. Okay. How long have you been living where you've been now? So this is like the one I'm living in as a new place, but before that, I've lived in another apartment for around five years, and that was a pretty old building. Okay. Do you have any pets? No pets, no. Okay. Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes? Yeah, I smoke, I'll say, around 20 cigarettes a day right now. All right. And did you smoke more previously? Yeah, I think I've been smoking for almost like 40 years now, and I used to smoke up to 30 cigarettes a day. Okay. Do you smoke cannabis? No. All right. And do you drink alcohol? Just maybe a couple of times a month. No, nothing, nothing throughout the week. Okay. So do you use any recreational drugs like IV drugs or opioids or co-sale? No, nothing like that. All right. And anybody in the family have any similar symptoms before, like coughing up blood or I know, not that I know my father passed away from a heart attack when he was in his 60s. And I think my mother had, like, I think one of the, like an arthritis. Yeah. But I think that was just like the one that you get with old age. Okay. Like, osteoarthritis? Yeah, that was the one. Okay. Any cancers in the family? Um, not that one of my own cause has like a bladder cancer, but that's that's about it. Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently or been around any sick contacts? Possibly people, anybody who's had tuberculosis or any infections? No, I've been pretty much to myself over the last few months, so not really. Okay. Um, was there anything that you were worried that this could be? Uh, yeah, just the blood, I kind of got scared, maybe I thought, you know, what if it's a cancer? Um, one of my friends had lung cancer. And I know I've been smoking for most of my life, so that's something I was worried about. Um, I can certainly see the the concern and I understand where you're coming from. Um, I think it would be very reasonable to investigate that today. Um, so we'll start with, um, uh, HSCT, um, along with, uh, some lab work, you'll get a CBC and some electrolytes. Um, also get an ECG as well if they just check your heart. And, um, we will, uh, see what the investigations show. Sounds good. Okay. And, um, other things that, uh, to think about, um, this could be, uh, also, like the COPD, uh, I know it's been going on a long time, but, um, possibly could have a pneumonia that's been lingering on, particularly if it's a fungal type of, uh, infection as well as, um, things like you mentioned, you possibly unsure if you've had an asbestos exposure in the past and stuff like that can possibly lead to, um, scarring of the lung. And so all of these, factors will be looked into. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you so much. All right. You're welcome. Thank you.",
