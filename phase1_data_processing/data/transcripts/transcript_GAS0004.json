  "transcription": "I understand that you've been having some diarrhea. Can you tell me a little bit about that? Yeah, sure. I've been having diarrhea for the past three to four days. And it's been pretty bad. I couldn't go to my classes. I had to skip because it was just embarrassing. OK, I'm sorry to hear that. Three to four. Have you had anything like this before? Have I ever experienced something like this before? Yeah, I don't think so. OK. And over the three to four days, have your stool all been loose or have you had some solid ones in between? I think it's mostly been loose. I think they've all been loose, actually. I think about it. OK, and how many times a day have you been having as a third of the day, area? Oh my god. I've lost count. I'm going every hour. Maybe. OK, I have hours. OK. And have you noticed any changes in the color of your stool? No, it's brown. OK. Any blood in your stool that you've noticed? I'm not really. I don't think so. I don't look that much, to be honest. OK. Have you noticed any pain associated with it? Well, I didn't start off with being, but I do have a bit of a cramp now since yesterday. It hurts sometimes. It comes and goes. OK. And do you feel that when it's, do you feel that you still have control over releasing it, do you like to sit come on? And then you don't even notice that it has happened, or you still are able to kind of have a warning before you get to the toilet. No, I do get a warning, but it's just, I do need to get to the toilet really fast. OK. Yeah. OK. And before this happens, have you noticed, have you, is there anything that you've done differently that you've been eating differently or any other changes that happened in your life recently? I did go to a new restaurant five days ago. OK. What have you had there? I just got some rice with chicken, chicken and durian. It was a nice little, any restaurant. And yeah. Did anyone else have the same thing that you did that you were with? I know, not really. I went with my friend and I haven't really, I haven't talked to her about this. I never really thought that these were related. That this was related to that. And it's, you know, absolutely, potentially not. Like it's maybe not. It could possibly be, so not to worry you about that. We just go like to get an idea of kind of the whole picture of what you're coming in this. So in terms of the last three to four days, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting? Yeah. Yeah. I have actually, but it's not been as bad as the diarrhea. I didn't even, yeah, I didn't even think about that. Yeah, I did vomit, I think, twice yesterday. OK. Have you noticed any blood in the vomit? No, it's just watery. OK. And are you nauseated all the time, or is it kind of on and off? It's on and off. OK. Have you taken any, any over-the-counter medicine or anything to help? Not really. I was trying to drink a lot of water, because I know that I can get dehydrated. So just drinking water. Yeah, that's all right. OK. So let's continue here. Have you been eating normally or have you not been eating as much as you regularly do? I have been eating less. Especially since yesterday when I had the best disease abdominal cramps started. I just don't feel like eating. OK. Is there anything that has been making it worse? Making what worse? In general, is there anything that you're finding makes your nausea or your diarrhea come on? Not really. I don't think so. Do you notice any changes to your urine or any discomfort when going to the bathroom? No. Have you traveled anywhere recently? No. OK. And have you noticed any fever or chills in the last few days? I've just been feeling really tired. And I don't know. Maybe I haven't checked my temperature. Have you noticed any rashes or changes in your skin? No. Do you notice any major changes to your weight? I know that you might not weigh yourself every day, but anything that jumps out to you? I actually haven't weighed myself in the past five days, so I don't know. OK. OK. OK. And I'm just going to jump to you in your general history. Do you have any history of problems with your digestive system? No. OK. Do you have any chronic conditions that you see if they're only doctor for regularly? I have asthma. OK. You take any medications? Yeah, I've got some buffers that my family dog gave me. OK. Nothing else? No, that's it. Do you have any medications? No, I don't. Have you supplied some of them? Sorry, can you see that again? Have you ever been hospitalized in the past? I haven't had wisdom teeth removed, but no, I wasn't hospitalized. No. Have you been in contact with anyone recently that's been sick? Nope. I don't think so. OK. Is that your living situation right now? You said you're a student? I am. OK. And do you live on your own, the family with roommates? I'll live with roommates. Do you drink alcohol? Sometimes. OK. How many drinks per week would you say? I might have a glass or two on the weekends. OK. Do you smoke? No. OK. Do you use any other substances? Nope. And what would you eat on a regular day? Typical. Your typical diet, please. Oh gosh. Well, I like to have oatmeal for breakfast. I usually make something quick for lunch, maybe like a salad. And then I might have, I'll probably just eat out at night, maybe get a burger or fries or something. OK. Cool. And I just wanted to jump over to ask you about your family history. Does anyone in your family have any history of digestive problems or abdominal problems, abdominal surgeries? My brother had a band of side-as. When he was young, my mom has had his direct to me. If that counts. If that counts? Yeah. Nothing else. OK. OK. Thank you for sharing that with me. So I think that's everything that I wanted to ask you for today.",
