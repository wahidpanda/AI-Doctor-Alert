  "transcription": "way help you. Hi Chris. So I was playing soccer the other day and I got kicked in the knee and since then my knee has been hurting and it looks a little bit red and a little bit swollen on the medial aspect of my right knee. Okay and and this started right after the kick at soccer. Yes. Okay and how many days ago was this? This was two days ago. Okay since then as the pain didn't getting any better or worse or staying the same. No it's staying the same or a little bit worse. Okay. Could you describe the pain? Is it sharp, achy? Yeah it's pretty sharp. Okay and do you feel the pain radiates anywhere like down the leg or up into the thigh? I know. Okay. Any pain that the posterior aspect of the knee or the lateral aspect? No. Okay. And is there anything that makes the pain worse? I guess if I press on that area or I try to let it out flex or extend my knee too much. Okay and anything that you've tried to make the pain better? Some ice helps. Okay. And have you noticed swelling over the area? Just a little bit. Okay and redness as well? Yes. Okay and what would you say the severity of the pain is attempting the worst pain that you've ever felt and one being low intensity pain? I give it about a five. Okay and if you had any injuries or any knee pain before? No. Okay and at the time of the injury, did you hear a pop sound or any kinds of sounds like that? I don't recall. Okay and how about any difficulties walking or having any knee instability? A little bit. Only when I like try to extend or flex my knee too much. Okay. And all right so have you been experiencing any other symptoms? No. All right. Just to be comprehensive I'll run through a review. So have you been having any headaches? No. Any sensory changes like changes to vision, hearing, spell or taste? No. Okay. Any eye symptoms or ear symptoms? No. Have you had a runny nose or sore throat? No. We had a cough? No. Any shortness of breath? No. Have you had any wheezing? No. Have you had any chest pain? No. Any heart palpitations or heart racing? No. Okay. Have you had any fainting or dizziness? No. All right. Have you had any nausea or vomiting? No. Have you had any changes to your appetite? Like loss of appetite? No. Have you had any weight loss unexpectedly? No. Okay. Have you had any abdominal pain? No. Any changes to bowel habits? Diarrhea, constipation? No. Okay. Have you had any urinary problems like pain or frequency? No. All right. Have you had any skin changes such as brat rashes or anything like that? No. Okay. Any joint pains anywhere else? No. Okay. And any fatigue? No. Okay. All right. And in the past, have you had or have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions? I know. Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications? No. No. Nothing. I know of. Are you currently taking any medications? No. All right. And have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations before? No. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about your living situation, like who you're living with and whereabouts? Sure. I live with with my parents and three of my siblings. Okay. I am. Are you going to school? I am. I'm in my last year of grade 12. Okay. That's good. How has happened going? It's been going okay. We've been doing part online part in person. Okay. Have you been around anybody who's been sick? No. All right. And you play soccer. Do you play any other sports? And I play football. Okay. Cool. And any injuries before to your knee or anything like that? I know. I'm in the past. All right. And do you smoke cigarettes? No. Do you drink alcohol? No. Okay. And you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or anything else? No. Okay. Are you currently sexually active? I am. Okay. Are you in a relationship? I am. I have been together for a year. Okay. Is there any concern for sexually transmitted infection? No. We were both tested. Okay. Great. And any chance that you could be pregnant? No. Okay. Okay. And in the family, are there any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions? No. Okay. And so that was everything I wanted to ask on history. So for the physical exam, when I'm inspecting the knee, are you seeing any joint effusions or joint swelling or echinosis or bruising? Um, it looks, it's not a bruise. It looks red. And I would say it's a little bit swollen on the video aspect, Ome. Okay. Is there any muscle atrophy? No. Okay. And is there any misalignment or joint deformities? No. Not that I notice. Okay. And on gait or walking, is there any limb for antelgy? No. If you're able to walk normally? I am able to walk normally. It hurts, but I think I'm walking okay. Okay. And next is there any changes to temperature? Like does that joint itself feel hot? No. Okay. And are there any areas of the joint line itself of the knee that is paying to the palpation? Just the medial part of it like the, I guess where the ligament would be? Okay. So just let me, okay. Any pain over the patella? No. Any pain over the tubular tuberosity or patella tendon? No. Any pain over the fibular head or the lateral part of the knee? No. Any pain on the calf or the thigh muscles? No. Any pain on the hamstring muscles? No. Okay. And is there any pain to a, like, various stress of the knee? To the various stress. I guess there will be pain if I press down in that area. Okay. And is there any joint, you know, joint laxity or pain to like a valgus stress of the knee? Yeah. So when I press, when I do that, it hurts on the medial aspect but not the lateral aspect. Okay. And does it feel as though there's some, like, the joints opening more when you put the valgus stress? A little bit, yes. Okay. And is there any instability moving that tibia anteriorly if you're like, pull it outwards? No. And how about if you pull the tibia posteriorly, any instability? No. Okay. And is there full range of motion of the knee? Yes. And full range of motion of the hip and ankle? Yes. Okay. And then do you have any, like, numbness, tingling or muscle weakness? No. Okay. And any sensory changes to the skin? No. Okay. And reflexes aren't normal. Okay. So I think that was everything I wanted to ask and kind of go through on the physical exam. Did you have any other questions or anything that maybe I forgot to mention today? No, that was it. Just what can I do about my knee? Yeah. So right now it's sounding like this could be an MCL or a medial collateral ligament strain or injury. And so these types of injuries are usually treated conservatively, like with things like NSAIDS or anti-inflammatories to help the pain and swelling. If the pain, depending on how severe it is, it might be useful to use maybe crutches for a day or two to try to help let the pain subside and allow you to be able to do some physical therapy exercises, like strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. But typically injuries that are lower grade will heal within two weeks. And so if it's more severe, it could take a bit longer. And although it's most likely MCL injury that you're describing, it could be a medial meniscal injury as well, or possibly even a percitis at the medial aspect of the knee. But the treatment to start with would be the same and maybe we'll get a knee x-ray if things aren't improving. Okay, that sounds good. Thank you.",
