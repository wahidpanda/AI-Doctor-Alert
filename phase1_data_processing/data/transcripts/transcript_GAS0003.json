  "transcription": "what brings you in here today? Yeah, hi. I'm... I have a baby in my belly. It started a couple hours ago. Okay, and where exactly in your belly do you have this pain? It's mostly up here on the right side. On the right side? Yeah. And can you describe what kind of pain is? Is it like a dollopene, a sharp pain, an aching pain? Ah! I guess it's an aching pain I'd say. It kind of just... it would initially just come and go. But now it's just... it's staying. It's not going away. Okay. And so it's in the right area. Does it travel anywhere else where besides it? From the right side? No. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least amount of pain you're felt in your life and 10 being the worst. How much would you rate it right now? It's about a... an aching. An aching? Okay. And so just to clarify when did it start? So about eight hours ago? Eight hours ago. And were you doing anything before? Like did you have a meal or how were you asleep and it woke you up? What was going on before you had the pain? I was just about to go to sleep. I wasn't doing anything in the takeover at the time. Okay. And has it been getting worse since it first started? Oh yeah. And it would come and go... But now for the past, I'd say five to six hours, it's been constant. It's just there all the time. Okay. And have you had any similar pain like this in the past? Yeah. I have a thing being that sort of comes and goes after I eat. Usually after I've had something like a... something fatty, something from outdoors, maybe like a burger or fries or something. I initially thought it was indigestion, but I don't know what's going on now. Okay. And does anything make it better or worse? Anything that you've tried? Well, I guess eating sometimes makes it worse. But I don't think there's anything that's making it better. Okay. Have you tried any meditations at all? I tried Tylenol, but that didn't do anything. And besides the pain that you're having, do you have any nausea or vomiting? I am a little nauseous, but no, I haven't... I haven't vomiting yet, no. Okay. And have you been having any fevers? I don't think so. I haven't checked. But I don't think it's feverish. Any sweats or like chills? No. I don't think so. Okay. Any changes in your bowel movements like constipation diarrhea? No. Okay. Have you traveled the... have you ever recently? No, I haven't. Have you been feeling at all very tired, not your usual self, fatigue? Well, the pain is making you difficult for me to do things. But I guess I'm not a little bit deep, baby. Okay. Have you been having any changes in your urinary patterns? No. Any changes in your skin, any rashes, any yellowing of your skin? Nothing that I've noticed. No, I don't think so. Okay. Any changes in your urine color? No. Okay. Have you noticed blood in your stool, at all? I have not. Okay. And how about your appetite? Has this changed at all? Well, I guess because this pain happens, usually happens after I eat, I think I've been eating less than usual. Just because I don't want to, you know, I don't like the pain. Okay. Any significant weight loss recently? I don't think so. Any recent infections recently at all? Nope. And otherwise, are you, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, blood pressure, anything else? I do have diabetes, but that's about it, I think. And do you take anything for your diabetes? I take my form. Okay. Do you take any other medications at all? No. No, I don't. Do you have any allergies to any medications? No. Any environmental allergies? No, no, I don't. Okay. Have you been hospitalized in the past? No, no, no, haven't ever. I've been very, I've been healthy. No hospitalizations. Any past surgeries? I got my vicinity removed when I was a teenager. Okay. Have you been in contact with anyone who has been ill recently? No, I don't think so. Okay. And in terms of your family history, has anyone had any cancers or any IVD, like Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis? No, not that I know of. Anything that runs in the family at all? My dad had a heart attack. When he was in his 60s. That's it. Okay. And currently right now, do you work? No, I'm lead off because of COVID. Okay. And currently, what is your home situation like? What do you mean? So do you live in an apartment, a house, and do you live with anyone? I live in an apartment. I live alone. Okay. And in terms of your daily routine, you feel that you get an exercise, do you go outside the walks or runs, anything like that? I usually go out for a run, especially when it's a little bit warmer, which it now is. Yeah. And do you drink, also? Sometimes. Okay. How much would you say you drink in an average of three? I wanted to drink a day. Okay. And what do you usually drink? I'll just drink a glass of wine at night, which helps me relax. Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes? I don't. Okay. And do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana? No, I don't. Okay. All right. So that's all the questions I have. And just to clarify, does your pain come and go or is it constant? Yeah. So initially it would come and go. But now for the first two hours, it would come and go. And when I would have the pain when I was eating, it would come and go. But over the past six hours, it's just been...",
