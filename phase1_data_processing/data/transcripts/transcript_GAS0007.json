  "transcription": "So I understand even experiencing some abdominal pain? Yeah, yeah, stomach hurt. It started hurting more. Last couple of days, maybe three days ago, I think. Okay. So for three days ago, for the last three days, you said it's been hurting more. Did you have pain before that? It felt weird, like crampy. I just, I either thought I was contemplated because of me. But I haven't been able to go to the bathroom as well. I just saw it kind of bloated a bit, but yeah, about that time, it started to feel a little bit more painful. Okay. Can you tell me kind of where you're feeling the pain the most? Yeah, kind of like near my right hip, like lower, where my stomach is, but kind of right and below my belly bone. Sometimes a little bit on the top, just below my belly bone, but mainly just not right lower side, yeah. Okay. Have you ever had pain like this in the past? No, never. Okay. And for the last three days, has it been pretty constant? Has it been on and off? I feel it's been getting worse to be honest. Is there anything that you think of this made it feel better? Honestly, just resting flat makes it feel a little bit better, but nothing much now. Okay. Is there anything that makes it worse? Touching it. Also, I keep the other day, and that made it definitely feel worse. Does that whole contraction of my body was nasty? Okay. Is it just the one time? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You had nausea associated with this? Mm-hmm. Okay. Does the pain stay in that same spot or does it move anywhere else? It's pretty much stayed in that one spot, yeah. Have you noticed any fever or something? It felt a bit hot the other day. Didn't take it to temperature though. Okay. Okay. And what specifically prompted you to come in today to be more into the park? I thought it was just going to get better when I first started. Maybe it's a bit of gas, but here we are kind of Thursday now, and it's still pretty bad. Okay. I mean, been in contact with anyone that's been sick lately? Not off the top of my head, no. And have you traveled anywhere? Okay. And I forgot to ask you, you notice any changes to your bowel habit? Yeah. Yeah. I was fairly regular about once a day. Five days ago, starting to be constipated, we'll get backed up pretty much the picture of. And last time I went to the bathroom was two days ago, I think. Yeah. Okay. I'm just going to ask you some questions about your overall health. Do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for? Or any other doctor? I got diabetes type two. Okay. And is that generally has up in well control for you lately? Most part, doctor checks my shoulders. I'm not too regular on them myself. But last time he changed his medications was a couple years back and I've just been on the same ones ever since. Okay. What medication are you currently taking? Metformin. Metformin. And have you given her how to be surgery? No, I help my teeth pulled as a kid. No. Okay. So you're appendix. Yeah. Yeah. I never had that problem as a kid. Okay. And do you have any allergies? No. Sometimes get a little bit congested during the fall, but that's it. Do you have any family history of doctor and personal problems? Yes. Like, no. I think my grandma died of breast cancer fairly early, but not that I can think of. Okay. And in just in terms of your lifestyle, do you live here in town? Yeah. Yeah. I live a little in a root family. No, I got family. Me to life. I got two kids, one of them's college, now, with them. Yeah. Nice. And what do you do for work? Or are you retired? I'm still working. I'm a production overseer, a production manager, over at Fairbanks. Oh, okay. You're a big boss. I took a while to get here. I'm sure it was very hard work. In general, do you drink alcohol? Oh, yeah. Well, I'm like, well, I'm planning on drinking on the two four, but, oh, regular special occasions, being hot days. Sometimes I'll have a beer too. Here. And do you smoke cigarettes? No. I haven't been able to smoke in the past. No. Okay, do you use cannabis? No. Okay, any other substances? No. Okay. Is there anything else you wanted to bring up today that I didn't ask you about? Or any other questions that you have? No. Just open a good answer to whatever's going on. Okay. Okay. Well, at this point, I will do a quick physical exam. We might want to have blood work done. Maybe some other tests based on what we find out from there. And then we can kind of let you know after that what the next steps will be. So I'm just going to take this and go over with the solution that I'm working with. And we'll talk you short. Thanks for talking with us. Thanks, Doc.",
