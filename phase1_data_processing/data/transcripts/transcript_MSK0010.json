  "transcription": "How may I help you? I just came in here today. I've been having a lot of shoulder pain that's just kind of left me not doing any of my activities recently. System or left shoulder. OK. And when did this pain start? It started five days ago. But it became pretty bad. And I've been kind of having like a somewhat of a pain for the last couple of weeks. But it got really bad just this week. OK. Did you have any trauma to this shoulder, like any injuries or triggers that could have caused the pain? I have been just going to the gym more frequently over the last few months, lifting weights, and things like that. But just this week I wasn't really able to do that either. OK. When you were lifting weights, like a few days ago, was there an episode where there was an acute onset of the pain? It got worse kind of right away. I think it was more progressive. But five days ago, I do feel that there was just I was having some pain before that. But then I just noticed all working. I started having more pain. But yeah, I don't think there was anything like sudden that happened though. OK. But yeah, I was progressing. And then it got acutely worse with the weight lifting. It sounds like. Maybe I did increase my weight in the last two weeks. So I did feel like a little bit more pain that increased last week. OK. I see. And in the left shoulder, do you feel the pain at the front that the sides or back? It hurts particularly in the front part of the shoulder. OK. Do you feel that it's radiating anywhere else? Just my whole left shoulder, nothing else really. OK. And could you describe the character or the quality of the pain? Is it sharp or is it achy? It's more achy. But certain, like some movements, it can get kind of sharp. OK. And has there been anything that has made the pain worse? If I just, if I carry anything with my left arm, or if I have to lift anything, or place it on my shoulder, like it really hurts. OK. And have you done anything that spayed it better? I just like resting it, not carrying anything and trying not to look behind on my shoulder. OK. So you're sleeping on the right side then? Yeah. OK. And what would you say the severity of the pain is on a scale of 1 to 10? If I'm not doing it, doing anything or not doing much, it's probably like a 2 or 3. But if I try to carry anything, it goes up to like probably like a 7. OK. And do you do any repetitive overhead activities, things like playing basketball, or just lifting things like above your head at the gym? Not recently. Just like normal weight exercises. Maybe with the bands, I do some overhead exercises. But in terms of sports, I used to play a lot of tennis. I did have some issues with the same shoulder, which is why I kind of stopped playing tennis. My doctor said I might have to open and use that shoulder. But that was like a couple of years back, so I thought it must have healed by now. OK. So previous overuse injury of the left shoulder. OK. And have you had any trauma to the shoulder? No, not that I know. OK. Have you had any fevers or chills? No. Have you had any night sweats? No. OK. Have you had any skin rashes or skin changes? No. OK. So even over the area, you haven't noticed any redness or soft tissue swelling? No. OK. Have you had any chest pain? Nope. OK. How about any shortness of breath? No, not that I've noticed. OK. Have you had pains in any other joints? No, just my shoulder. OK. And have you had any recent infections or symptoms such as like a runny nose or sore throat or even a cough? No, nothing like that. OK. And how about any nausea or vomiting? No. OK. And how has your sleep been the past couple of nights? So you mentioned you haven't been able to lay on your left side? Yeah, it's been pretty painful. I kind of wake up every time I accidentally go onto my left side. OK. Sorry. You're getting worse thing at pain at night. OK. Have you had any weakness? Do you feel like you have less strength than your arm? OK. I do feel that there might be some less strength than my left arm, but I'm not really using it much, so it's hard to tell. OK. And how about range of motion? Do you feel as though you could lift your left arm up to scratch your head and back? It does hurt when I try to lift my arm up. OK. So it sounds like range of motion is decreased. OK. And have you had an altered sensation of your arms being numbness or tingling? No. I haven't felt any of that. OK. And have you had any changes to your bowel habits, like constipation or diarrhea? No, nothing like that. Have you had any abdominal pain? No. And have you had any urinary problems? No. OK. And in the past, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions? No, I've been pretty healthy, actually. Just that overuse injury two years ago. OK. Great. And do you have any allergies to medications? No. OK. Do you take any medications regularly? Just recently, I've been taking a lot more of the hydro, but that's about it. OK. And have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries? No, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. OK. Could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently, like who you're living with and whereabouts? Yeah. So I'm living with my wife in a small condominium in downtown. OK. And are you working currently? Yeah, I'm working as a university agent. OK. And do you drink alcohol? Rarely, just on some occasions. That's about my goal, you know. OK. How about smoking cigarettes or cannabis? No, I'm never smoked. Do you use any recreational drugs or have you in the past? No. OK. And so the next part, just for that physical exam, so you have pain with shoulder abduction? Yes. Yes. So just, yeah, I do have some pain, especially from, yeah, pain throughout abduction. OK. Is there any pain that's parts of that range of motion that are more painful for you? Yeah, so probably from 60 degrees to 120 degrees, is more painful. OK. And if your arm is outstretched and you're thumb pointing down, so your arm is internally rotated, does that give you pain? OK. Um, yes. If, yeah, not just like that, but if you were to like press down on it, the internal rotation does cause a little bit of pain. OK. Um, OK. So it sounds like a positive job's test and a positive nearest test as well as a painful arc for your shoulder. And is there pain to palpation? Just, yeah, definitely just at the front of the shoulder, there's some pain over with palpation. OK. And sensation is normal, reflexes are normal. And strength is slightly reduced as well. OK. So that was everything that I wanted to ask on history and check, ask about on the physical exam as well. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention today that I may be forgot? No, I think that's it. OK. So based on the symptoms today, along with your age and prior history of an overuse injury of the left shoulder, it certainly raises concern of having an rotator cuff tear or a rotator cuff impingement syndrome where there is inflammation there and not necessarily actually a full tear of the muscle that's causing the pain. So those would be the two most likely things, yeah, the rotator cuff tear or subacromial impingement syndrome. And so we want to get an ultrasound of the left shoulder to evaluate the structures and possibly some other imaging, which is an X-ray or MRI to determine the extent of the injury in the left shoulder. OK. Sounds good. Thank you.",
