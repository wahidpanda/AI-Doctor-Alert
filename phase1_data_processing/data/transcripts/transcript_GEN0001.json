  "transcription": "That will bring you to clinic today. Hi, so I feel like I might have a bladder infection. I see a urologist because I've had some issues with like an overactive bladder for a while. I've had to see bladder infections in the past and this is usually how they feel. You guys feel like a little bit of burning when I go to the bathroom and I have to go like a lot right now. But then also sometimes it means that like it gets like this when I have my period and I don't have my period right now, but I, you know, I could be getting it, but I also just don't want to let it go. Keep going if I do have an infection. I just like, how they get it treated if I do. Okay, understood. When was your last period? Like two weeks ago? About two weeks ago. Are you fairly regular? Like yes and no. I'm not super irregular, but I sometimes have like basically it's like I alternate sometimes I, my cycle's like four weeks and sometimes it's more like five. Sorry, let's clarify. I get your third year's old. Yeah, I'm 30. Okay, are you only your contraception right now? No, I'm not. Okay, are you sexually active at all? No. No. Okay. So just in terms of your, you're in a retractive sections, what was your last one? I had one like three months ago, maybe three months ago. Okay. And they prescribed you antibiotics and it went away really quickly. Yeah, yeah, I went away. Like I always, I always have a no-vractive bladder and I always have to go pretty frequently like every hour sometimes half hour, but that's still there. But it's like it hasn't, it's been I haven't had any like pain. Okay, so you still have quite a, you have a, quite a bit of urgency to go. Kind of keep going more frequently, but I suppose the new thing they are a little bit concerned about is that it burns a little bit, stays a little bit when you do your knee. Am I understanding correctly? Exactly. Like for the past couple of days, it's about like that. Okay. Has it been getting progressively worse at all? Maybe a little bit. I feel like now I can recognize it pretty early when it's not too bad to kind of get ahead of it. Okay, understood. And do you have any pain kind of behind your ribs at all? When you're back. So I can repeat that. You haven't had any pain on your back, middle back kind of close to your ribs, have you? Not that I can think of. Okay. And have you noticed any changes to the quality of the year? For example, is it frothy or smelled bad? It maybe looks like a little cloudy. Nothing else out of the ordinary. Like I've never had blood in it or anything. Understood. Have you noticed any visual changes in the area here for Jaina? No, not that I can't see anything like that. Anything concerned for an STI that you're worried about? No. And like I haven't had a sexual partner in a few years. I'm understood. Understood. Is it kind of questions that we ask when someone's having a little bit of maybe an issue holding in their ear? But you are felt any numbness or inability to feel kind of around your buttocks region. For example, when you wipe with tissue paper, can you feel that well? Oh, yeah, I can feel everything. Okay. And no changes to your poops, to your balance. No. Well, it's pretty normal. Okay. And how do you feel otherwise? I mean, I feel a little tired. I felt like a little hot yesterday. I don't have a thermometer. I didn't take my temperature. But sometimes I feel a little hot like when I've had the infections before. Okay. You don't have me swelling on your body or your ankles, do you? No. I'm not. Anywhere on your body or your ankles, do you? No. No. Okay. And then so no puffiness around your eyes that you've noticed? No. I can't believe that. Any rashes or any changes on your face? Like my mom said, I saw my mom earlier and she said I looked like a little flushed. But it's not like a rash or anything. No. No markings across the bridge of your nose and your cheeks. No. Okay. And then in regards otherwise you feel a little flushed or tired. Any other medical issues that you have? No, just this like overactive bladder thing. Okay. And have they given you any medications for it? We tried a few different ones before. And now I get I get Botox injections into the bladder like maybe twice a year. Anything else they've used recently? Like any medications you're on right now, I suppose? No, nothing. No, nothing else. I guess I have like I have an inhaler, but I don't use it all the time. Like I haven't had it here in a while. So you have asthma? Yeah, like I honestly don't feel like I have it very much now, but I still have like I still have. Understood, understood. Anything else you've taken medications for in the past? Oh, I used to take birth control like the pill, but like I just I don't have the right now. And then it didn't really feel like I needed it otherwise. Understood, understood. And have you had any past surgeries? Um, I had my handiczo when I was 24. And that's it though. Okay, got it. And then just in terms of you yourself, do you live in London? Yeah, yeah, I do. Okay. Oh, what do you do for work? I work at a bank. Do you have any children? No. Okay. And in regards to anything, so any sick contacts? Uh, no. Any recent travel? No. Any allergies? Uh, like sometimes in this ring, I'll get like a little stuffy. Okay, so it's good. I feel like a lot of things are going to be like, yeah. Nothing too concerned. No drug allergies. No, nothing like that. I got it. Okay, I think what now doing next, I'll move to a physical exam. I think we might just do some investigations just in order to get some more information. And then the physician will come into see you. Okay. Well, thank you.",
