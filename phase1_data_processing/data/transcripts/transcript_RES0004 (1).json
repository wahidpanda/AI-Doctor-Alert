  "transcription": "Nice to meet you, what's your name? My name's Scott, it's nice to meet you too. All right, so Scott, how old are you? I'm 15. 15? OK, what brings you in today? I've had a sore throat now for a couple of weeks, and it's just not going away. Couple of weeks? OK, so about two weeks, three weeks? Yeah, about two to three weeks. OK. What does it feel like? Is it kind of like a burning feeling? Is it more like an itchy feeling? What does it feel like? I would say it's kind of, yeah, like burning or or scratchy. OK. And does it hurt when you swallow? It does, yeah. When my throat hurts when I'm eating or swallowing it, like liquid as well, but cold stuff seems to make it feel a little bit better. OK, good. And does your neck hurt too? A little tender. I've noticed the some lumps at the front of my neck that have been a bit sore. OK. And is it mostly sore kind of like midline or is it more sore to one side versus the other? Maybe the right side is a little bit more sore, but I can feel it on both sides of my neck. OK. And how bad would you say your discomfort is one to 10, 10 being the worst? I would say maybe a two or three. If I move my neck, I can feel it more, but otherwise it can just barely notice that it's there. OK. So it's not preventing you from sleeping, going to school, playing, things like that. No, it's more so the sore throat when swallowing. OK. OK. Have you noticed a fever at all? I have. Yeah, I felt hot and I checked my temperature this morning and it was 38.7. I think it was. Is that a fever? Yeah, I'd say that's a fever. We can also do another temperature check today. OK. Yeah, but that definitely sounds like a fever. Have you noticed rashes anywhere? Yeah, I've had this red, I guess, pink rash that I have noticed. It's come over my chest and belly area. OK. How big is it? Is it more than a centimeter? Uh-huh. Yeah, it's pretty well. I mean, it's kind of spread out over an area. It's not all continuous, I guess. You can kind of see patches or blockages. OK. And is it raised? No, it's not raised. OK. OK. Is it itchy? No, it's not itchy. OK. Painful? No, not painful. OK. And is it bleeding or oozing anything like pus? No, it's not. Nothing like that. It's just pink and red and it's just kind of showed up over the last little while. I've noticed it on my hands a little bit, too. OK. And you said the started when? Like was this before the sore throat or after? I can't remember the onset. I think the sore throat started first and the rash came a little bit later. OK. OK. And have you noticed that your glands are swollen? I think so. Maybe that's what's swollen in my neck. OK. OK. How about coughing? No, I haven't had a cough. No. And how about a stepy nose or a runny nose? Nothing like that. OK. Body aches. Yeah, it felt some muscle aches, for sure. OK. Upper limbs or lower limbs? I'd say a kind of whole body. I just feel like my muscles and joints are sore. OK. Yeah. And are do you have any headaches? No, I haven't really had any headaches. No, OK. And how's your appetite? Are you still eating well? It might be a little bit down. I just haven't been feeling so great. So I'm probably eating less the last few weeks. Yeah. Have you been around anyone who may have been sick recently? Yeah, actually, I think a few of my friends, or there was somebody in my gym class who decided they had similar symptoms. OK. OK. And when was this? Now I think about it. Probably about three or four weeks ago. OK. And were they ever treated for that? Did they see a doctor? I'm not sure. No. OK. No worries. I just remember them being off for school because they were sick. OK. Yeah. Any issues with your eyes? No. No. Nothing like crusting or pus coming out of your eyes, red eye, anything like that. No. No, they have looked to me a little bit more red than usual, but I haven't noticed anything in terms of itching is or discharge. OK. Any nausea or vomiting? No, no, no nausea or vomiting. OK. How about your stool? Have they been normal? Have you had diarrhea, constipation, anything like that? Those no changes to your bowel habits. OK. How about urine? That's been OK. OK. OK. Have you ever had these symptoms before? I mean, I've had sore throats in the past, but not while feeling like this, though. Yeah. OK. When was the last time you had a sore throat? I don't know. Maybe when I was a kid. OK. It's been a while. Yeah. Like a strep throat kind of thing, more or more viral. Yeah. I do remember getting antibiotics when I was younger. OK. OK. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any medical conditions? I was diagnosed with asthma. OK. And are you on any medications for that? Yeah. So I just use Ventilin as needed, but otherwise. Oh, and then I take flow vent daily. So. OK. I think that's the one. There's a couple of inhalers that I take. OK. OK. And any other medications? Sometimes I'll take like reactin or some other type of allergy pill, but that's it. OK. What are you allergic to? Well, I would say mostly seasonal allergies. But yeah, seasonal allergies and dust, maybe. OK. And are you up to date with all your immunizations? Yeah. My mom makes me get the flu shot every year. OK. Good. And OK. Have you seen another doctor for the symptoms at all? Have you been worked up for that? Any blood work testing done for it already? No, I thought I would have felt better by now. And so I haven't seen anybody, but it's kind of just been going on now and not seeming to get better. So I want to come see somebody. Yeah, for sure. Have you tried anything for your symptoms, any medications, anything over the counter? Yeah, I've had some Tylenol. And I think what is it, Advil? And the devil is helped with some of the kind of aches and pains, but they've come right back. OK. Any family history of lung issues, heart issues? No, nothing like that. No. Yeah. OK, have what cancers? I think my grandfather had a pancreatic cancer. OK. OK. All right. So you live at home, correct? Yeah, I live with my parents and my younger sister. She's 12. She's 12. Is she healthy? Yeah, she is. OK. Good. And have you guys traveled recently? No, we've been at home. OK. OK. And do you smoke? No, I don't smoke. No. How about marijuana? I've tried it once or twice, but just those couple of times. Nothing that I do or use regularly. OK. And how about alcohol? No, no alcohol. No alcohol. OK. Are you sexually active? No, I'm not. No, OK. Is there a possibility that, or actually, sorry, I should repeat this, that have you kissed anyone recently? I guess I kind of have a girlfriend now that I started hanging out with about two months ago. OK. OK. And so I guess yes. OK. All right. Well, that's good. Um, I have, how she had any of these symptoms? Well, she wasn't feeling well for a while back, but I don't think it was this bad for her. OK. And she's better now? Yeah, she's better now. OK. All right. So you mentioned your loss actually active. If you were to be, make sure you use protection. And OK. So everything at home is OK then. No one's sick at home, you mentioned, right? Yeah, no one's sick at home. OK. And school is going OK? All right. Yeah, school's been going OK for the most part. It's been tough days. Last few weeks feeling like this, though. Yeah, for sure. And are you and your girlfriend in an exclusive relationship? I think so, yeah. OK. I asked because there's something called what you may be familiar with and it's called the Kissing Disease in medical terminology. It's called Mono as caused by a virus called EBV. So it could be that, though. We're covering all our bases. Oh, I've heard of Mono before. Yeah. OK. It's likely I could be up there in terms of what you have. So I think those were all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions for me? Anything you wanted to add? No, I think that's you cover everything. OK. All right. So we'll go off a few. We'll try to cover our bases and get you tested for Mono, which you'd have to do like a Mono spot test. And we can do a rapid test as well. This EV has something called Streptro. But yeah, we'll see what those results come back as and we'll go from there. Does that sound good? Yeah. No, that sounds good. OK. Thank you.",
