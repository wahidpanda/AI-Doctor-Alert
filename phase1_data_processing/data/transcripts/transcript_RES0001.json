  "transcription": "brings you in today. So I've just had this pain in my chest for just over a week now. And it's constantly to have trouble breathing. Okay. How old are you Jen? 52. 52. Okay. When did this pain start? You said a week back. Yeah, just about that. I think maybe eight days ago. Okay. And is it a constant pain? Is it always there? It is, but it's definitely worse that it's the breathing that's been bothering me a lot more when I take a deep breath. The pain's a lot worse. Okay. Okay. And when you do get that, get that pain, how long does it last? Um, I would say, um, I don't know, 15, 20 minutes. It's, um, it goes away over, over time. Okay. And the shortness of breath, do you have that at rest as well? Uh, no. If I, if I take a break or, um, sit down to rest, then I can usually, uh, catch my breath. But if, even if I'm doing a little bit of exertion, like, um, walking a few, a few blocks or, um, something like that, I'm finding it. I'm short of breath. Okay. Um, do you, did anything trigger this a week back? Any trauma to the chest area, anything like that? Uh, no, no one else has been sick. I, I had a cough, um, about a week ago, um, and so I thought it might be a chest infection, but I'm not feverish. So, uh, I'm not sure. Okay. The cough isn't still there. Yeah. It's, um, I still have a cough. Okay. And, uh, are you, uh, coughing up any blood? No, I have it. I haven't noticed any, any blood. Okay. How about sputum? Um, no sputum. No. Okay. And do you feel like you're wheezing? Uh, no wheezing. No wheezing. Okay. Um, the shortness of breath, one to ten, ten being, uh, the worst, uh, the most severe. How bad is your shortness of breath? I would say, um, when I'm exerting myself, it could get up to like a seven or an eight. Okay. And you mentioned how, how far can you walk before you need to rest? Uh, I would say maybe a hundred meters. Okay. Before I was, um, able to run, uh, work, I was running, um, a few days per week. So, um, okay. It's honestly not like to eat. Okay. Um, and the chest pain is it sharp? Is it dull? Crampy? What does it feel like? I say it's sharp. Okay. Have you ever experienced this before? No, nothing like, like, like this before at all. I have never had any, um, any problems like this before. Okay. And, um, has it changed, uh, since it started a week back or has, uh, have your symptoms been pretty much the same? They've been pretty much the, the same. Okay. Okay. Um, do you have anything like COPD? congestive heart failure, anything like that? No, I've never had any heart problems, um, uh, in the past. Um, I, I've been healthy up to this point. No, um, nothing I see a doctor regularly for. Okay. Okay. Um, you mentioned no fever, no chills, um, no night sweats, too, I guess? Uh, yeah, no night sweats. Okay. And how about weight loss, any weight loss? Um, no weight loss. No. Okay. Um, um, have you experienced any changes in your vision? Uh, yeah, no, my vision's been, um, been fine. Okay, hearing, hearing has been okay. Okay, how about smell? No changes in smell. No, um, I have you had a step, you know, is there a runny nose in the past week or so? Uh, no, it was just the, the dry cough. Okay, dry cough. Um, any changes in your skin, like, rashes, uh, no rashes. Okay. And, uh, you mentioned some chest pain, any palpitations, like you feel like your heart's racing? Uh, actually I did feel like that a little bit, um, uh, especially when I was moving up a little bit more. I felt like my heart was, was racing. Okay. Um, any calf pain? Um, yeah, my left, my left leg's actually a little bit sore. Okay, any swelling in the area? Um, uh, no, I don't, don't see any swelling there. Okay. No. Um, yeah, we'll see that they're swelling. Okay. Okay. Um, and you mentioned shirt, as some shortness of breath, um, on exertion. How about when you're laying down? Uh, not when I'm laying down. No. Okay. And not when you're okay, not when you're laying down. Okay. Um, all right. And in terms of like your stool, uh, so bowel movements and urination, like all of that's normal. Yeah, all of that's been normal. Okay. Any headaches? Uh, no headaches. No, no confusion. Um, no, no confusion. Okay. How about dizziness or fainting spells? Um, no fainting spells. Okay. Okay. And have you already received any sort of imaging or pulmonary function test or anything like that for this recently? Uh, no, I, I, I haven't. Okay. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any past medical history of any conditions really? Um, no, like I've been, um, previously healthy. Um, but I, I guess I did have a hysterectomy a few weeks ago. I know it was, I didn't bring it up before because it's just a day procedure, but, um, I was definitely spending a lot more time, um, relaxing at home after that, um, a few weeks ago. Okay. Okay. So you haven't been moving around as much, I guess, since the hysterectomy. Yeah, exactly. It's starting to, it was starting to get, the pain was starting to improve, but, um, it was keeping me, uh, on the couch a lot of days. Okay. Yeah. Um, are you on any medications? Um, no, I tried, I tried some Tylenol and an Advil for the pain throughout this week and it didn't really help much. But, uh, other than that, don't take any, any medications, nothing for blood pressure or anything like that. Okay. And sorry, what was the hysterectomy for? Um, I, I was having a lot of, um, bleeding. Okay. So were they thinking it was, um, like a cancer or something? I think it, it, um, it was from, uh, uh, fibroids. Oh, okay. Okay. And, um, so you mentioned on medications, any allergies? Um, no allergies to medications. No. And are you up to date with any, with all your immunizations? Um, and yeah, you are. Okay. Any family history of lung conditions? Uh, no lung conditions. Okay. How about heart? Yeah. It was my, my mom had a heart attack when she was, um, 56. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry to give that. Um, and any, uh, history of family history of something called pulmonary embolism or, uh, DVTs? Uh, no, I haven't heard of, uh, heard of pulmonary embolism before. Okay. So it's basically, um, blood clots in your lung. And then DVTs are deep vein thrombosis. So also blood clots, but in different parts of your body. Okay. Yeah. Anything like that that you know of? Uh, I have, I might have heard of something like that, um, happening in my mom, actually, I might have been related to her, uh, heart attack, but I'm not specifically sure. Okay. Sure. Um, and then do you smoke? Um, I, I spoke, uh, maybe about half a pack of cigarettes per day. I've, I've spoken, um, ever since I was a teenager, I've tried to quit, uh, multiple times. I, I was smoking about a pack per day before. So I have cut it down, but, uh, still something that I'm working on. Okay. Good. I'm glad you're trying to cut down. Um, we have resources available if you're interested in somewhat help. Um, and do you smoke, um, marijuana? Uh, no, I don't. Okay. Any, uh, use of other recreational drugs? Uh, no. No. Okay. And how about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol? Uh, maybe a glass of wine on the weekends, but, um, other than that, no. Okay. Um, and have you had any sick contacts recently? People around you. People you live with that work. I can't think of anybody who's been sick. No. Okay. Okay. And, and what do you do for work, Jen? Um, I work as an administrator at, uh, at a bank. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, and have you traveled anywhere recently? Uh, no, I, I can't remember the last vacation. Okay. All right. Um, so, those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have anything that you wanted to add anything that I hadn't touched on? Um, no, I think you covered, uh, everything. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. No worries. So I guess at this point, we would do a physical exam, just take a listen to your lungs and your chest, um, after that. So right now, uh, it sounds like it could be something vascular, you know, like a pulmonary embolism like we talked about. That's kind of high on my list of, uh, things to work up for. Um, but also we don't want to miss other things, uh, you know, like cancer, infection, um, autoimmune things that could affect your lungs. So we'll just do a work up for all of that. Um, how does that sound? Yeah, whatever, whatever you think, uh, we need to do. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you for your time. Yeah. Thanks.",
