  "transcription": "What's you in? I've had this pain on the outside of my right elbow now. I first started noticing it several months ago, but recently it's just been more painful. Okay. So you said several months ago. Did anything happen several months ago? Was there any sort of trigger, trauma, anything like that to that area? No, there wasn't any trauma or any triggers that I noticed. I was just feeling it a bit more at the end of work. Yeah, I was just having a feeling of pain a bit more at the end of work. Okay. Does anything make it better or worse, the pain? Yeah, if I really if I'm just resting the elbow, it makes it better. And I've tried things like ibuprofen, which has helped with the pain. I'll do that for helping get through work sometimes if the pain's bad enough. Okay. And if you were to describe the quality of the pain, is it sharp, rocky, achy? It's kind of, well, it's achy and then sometimes depending on the movement, it can get, it can be sharp as well. Okay. Okay. And what sorts of movements make it worse? So like really it's mostly movements at my wrist. If I'm bending my wrist down, I can, I can feel it or if I'm having to pick things up or hold heavy objects at work, I do a lot of repetitive things that I can't do. Things that at work at work online. Okay. Okay. And once it's 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt, how bad is this pain? It is about a four. About a four. Okay. And have you ever experienced this type of pain before? No, I haven't. No, okay. And do you feel like your pain's getting worse over the past several months or is it the same getting better? It's been getting worse. It's been getting worse. Okay. Okay. Have you tried any like topical ointments or anything like that for it? I did. Yeah, I tried some stuff that you can get at the drug store and it did help take the edge off a little bit. Okay. All right. And are you still able to move that arm, your right arm as well as your hand? I am. Yeah. I have full range of motion of both the elbow and hand. Okay. And it's not like preventing you from doing everyday tasks. No, I've been able to manage so far at work, but it is starting to become an issue with my job. All right. And then do you have any sorts of aches or pains in any other joint or muscle groups? No, it's just right there on the outside of my right elbow. Okay. Really annoying because I'm right handed as well. So you guys causing problems there. Right. And is that pain radiating upwards or downwards? No, I kind of just feel it right over that that one spot. Okay. Any numbness or tingling in that arm? No, no numbness or tingling. Yeah. Okay. And then have a like your arm feeling like it's cold. No, I haven't had anything like that. All right. And then otherwise do you have any other symptoms? No, it's just been a little pain. Okay. So no weight loss. No, my weight's been stable over these last few months. Okay. Fever or chills? No, I haven't had any fevers or chills. Okay. Any fatigue? No, my energy's been good. Okay. Have about um, rashes. Uh, no rashes. Okay. Changes to your senses like vision hearing smell, smell or taste? No changes there. Okay. Any coughing, shortness of breath or weezing? No. Okay. Chest pain, any heart palpitations or uh, dizziness? Nothing like that. Okay. Changes to your bowel movements? No. No. No, no, not your vomiting? No, I haven't had any not your vomiting. Okay. Changes to your urine? No. I haven't had any urinary symptoms. Okay. And memory loss or confusion? No. Okay. So if you look at that right elbow, um, do you notice any redness or swelling? Uh, no, I don't. No. Okay. Does it seem misaligned or like asymmetrical compared to your other elbow? No, it looks, it looks the same. Looks the same. Okay. So no um, skin changes or deformities there? Uh, no. No. Okay. All right. And now I'm going to get you to um, just palpate um, that lateral, or yeah, the lateral aspect of that elbow. And you let me know if you feel pain when you push, push on that. I feel it's pain at the lateral, lateral elbow. How about the medial aspect? No pain. Okay. And have it when you palpate your forearm and your biceps. Uh, no pain. Okay. All right. And then do you feel like it's hot? That area? No. No. Okay. Now I am going to get you to um, extend your wrist. Okay. And then keep your elbow in full extension as well. Does that hurt? Uh, it does. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Have about when you flex your wrist with the elbow still in full extension. All right. It does. Yeah. That hurts as well. Okay. Have about when you flex your elbow. Uh, no, but that doesn't cause any pain. Have about when you extend your shoulder all the way up. No, nothing there. And then. Okay. And then flexing your, uh, sorry, adefting your shoulder. Not feels normal. All right. And then have about when you pronate and supinate your forearms. Uh, pronation. So like twist your arm inward so that your palm is facing the floor. No, that doesn't really cause any pain pronation and supination. Okay. All right. Um, all right. And then are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions? Um, I'm healthy. You're healthy. Okay. And then do you have, have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past? I had a surgery for a C section for my, my son, um, but that's, that's it. Okay. Okay. And, um, how long ago was that? That was about 17 years ago. Okay. And was that an emergency C section? Uh, no, it was not. Okay. Um, and then are you on any medications? Um, no, I've just been taking a Tylenol and an Anvil, um, for the pain. Okay. All right. Um, immunizations wise, are you up to date? I, I am. Yes. Okay. Do you have any allergies? Uh, no allergies. Okay. Family history of any, uh, skeletal or muscular, um, issues. Um, no, nothing like that in the family. Okay. Neurological issues in the family. Um, no neurological issues in the family. Okay. How about autoimmune conditions? Uh, no, nothing like that. Okay. And then, um, do you smoke? Uh, no, I haven't smoked before. Okay. Do you do marijuana? No, I don't use that. Um, alcohol. Um, uh, yeah, I'll have a glass of wine every once in a while, but maybe just one, one a week. And, uh, have you been around the context recently? Um, no, I haven't been around anybody who's been sick. Okay. Any recent travel? Uh, nope. I've been at home. Um, I think those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself? Uh, no. Well, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my, in my elbow. Yeah. So right now it seems like you may have a case of something called, um, lateral epicon delitis. So it's also known as, uh, tennis elbow. Um, and there are a lot of things I could kind of predispose you to this. Um, so it could be like the repetitive strain at work. Um, and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor, muscle group there. Um, so for this, we basically recommend, um, a couple of things to manage the pain. Uh, but first, uh, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures. Um, so to help you treat this, um, we recommend some activity modifications. So, um, at work, not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those extensor forum muscles. Um, and then you can use some, uh, use the compression sleeve as well. Continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain. And, uh, really important is physical therapy, um, to increase mobility and strength in that arm. Uh, and as well, you can apply things like ice, um, to it for, like the pain and swelling if you see any. Uh, yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most. Uh, but normally it does, um, go away in a couple months with some physical therapy and the, the compression and splints if you choose to do that. How does that sound? Yeah, that sounds, um, good. Thank you. Yeah, worries.",
